       "  'content': 'Virginia’s participation in an East Coast greenhouse gas emissions pact is pivotal to curbing the climate impact of its thriving data center industry.\\n\\nGlobally, northern Virginia has become one of the largest data center hubs over the last decade-plus. Offering generous tax incentives has attracted tech giants eager to construct massive server farms with proximity to crucial digital infrastructure. An estimated 70% of the world’s internet traffic moves through the suburbs of Washington, D.C., daily.\\n\\nThat burgeoning has propelled a surge in electricity use. In 2020, the sector consumed close to 12,000 gigawatt-hours in Dominion Energy’s territory — roughly one-sixth of the investor-owned utility’s total retail sales that same year.\\n\\nAnd yet, the state’s carbon emissions from power plants have fallen 12% annually during the last two years.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe, an environmental policy professor at the University of Virginia, is among those crediting the 11-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Known as RGGI, the initiative is a voluntary carbon cap-and-invest venture designed to tamp down heat-trapping gases emitted by the utility sector. Virginia’s downward emissions trend will halt without that cap in place, Shobe said.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe Credit: University of Virginia\\n\\nEven as electricity-hungry data centers multiply across the state, RGGI’s binding carbon cap keeps emissions in check. Basically, the amount of fossil fuels a utility is allowed to burn shrinks each year as the cap is lowered.\\n\\nIt’s a crucial dynamic to understand, Shobe said, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has vowed to extract Virginia from the market-based climate initiative.\\n\\n“As a planetary citizen, I’m happy with that [cap],” said Shobe, who directs the Energy Transition Initiative at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. “If the state relaxes RGGI, then data centers have climate consequences that we need to worry about.”\\n\\nHe’s hopeful that legislators won’t follow Youngkin’s lead on RGGI during the session that opened last Wednesday. Republicans control the House of Delegates while Democrats have a majority in the Senate.\\n\\nShobe also argues that continuing to build data centers in Virginia can be a net positive for climate change — assuming data centers will be built somewhere and the state stays committed to the regional greenhouse gas program. That construction trend shows no signs of abating in Virginia for at least the next 10 years.\\n\\n“As long as we are a member of RGGI, then we should encourage data centers here rather than Ohio, Indiana or someplace else without a cap on carbon dioxide emissions,” Shobe said.\\n\\nShobe played a significant role in designing the mechanisms behind RGGI, which debuted in 2009. In a nutshell, each member state limits emissions from fossil fuel power plants, issues carbon dioxide allowances and sets up participation in auctions for those allowances.\\n\\nIn 2020, Virginia became the first Southern state to join RGGI, after ample back-and-forth bickering. Advocates have hailed the program for its climate benefits and the upward of $450 million the allowance auction has so far yielded for statewide flood resiliency projects, energy efficiency upgrades, and home repairs for low-income residents statewide.\\n\\nYoungkin has been itching to extract Virginia from RGGI since he took office a year ago. In early December, the state’s Air Pollution Control Board voted 4-1 to accelerate that exit.\\n\\nAttorneys with environmental organizations maintain that the Youngkin administration lacks the authority to leave the compact. That decision, RGGI proponents say, is in the hands of the General Assembly. A legislative effort to derail RGGI failed last year.\\n\\nThe air board’s initial vote to leave RGGI will trigger a 60-day comment period this winter. Shobe and his colleagues are prepared to weigh in with insights that the board will review before voting again on the proposal.\\n\\nShobe published an electricity use forecast in April 2021 predicting that data centers will be the driving force behind a 38% increase in electricity sales between 2020 and 2035. That equals an average increase in electricity use of around 44,000 gigawatt-hours per year.\\n\\n“Whether we think this is a good thing or not, data centers are growing very fast,” Shobe said. “Unfortunately, they use a lot of energy. How we provide that energy is what will make a difference.”\\n\\nShobe noted that residential electricity sales are close to flatlining due to slower population growth and improved energy efficiency. Likewise, commercial and industrial demand have fallen for several years.\\n\\nFor the most part, large technology companies have pledged to power their facilities with renewable energy. However, it’s unclear whether or how they are following through on those commitments.\\n\\nThus far, Virginia’s solar expansion is on pace with a legislative mandate to decarbonize the grid by 2050, Shobe said. But the state can’t afford a solar stumble if it’s going to feed the needs of voracious data centers.\\n\\nSome in the environmental community doubt that server farms will be able to live up to their vows to harness 100% of their energy from clean sources. Rooftop solar can’t cover those needs because the average solar array on a data center would only offset about 2.2% of its annual electricity consumption, according to calculations by solar developers.\\n\\nThat means operators resort to power purchase agreements, which allow them to go solar even if the utility-scale arrays they invest in are located miles away or in other states and might not be generating when data centers are consuming power.\\n\\nSome are leery of those pacts. But Shobe defends the agreements as “perfectly fine ways” to contain greenhouse gases.\\n\\n“If a data center has a solar farm built somewhere else to cover emissions, why wouldn’t you want to credit them for that?” he said, adding that his university does just that with two off-campus arrays. “From the point of view of resolving global warming, it doesn’t matter where it is built.\\n\\n“As long as it’s on the same planet, it has the same effect on emissions.”\\n\\nShobe suggested that in the big picture, a third-party monitoring organization — along the lines of a Good Housekeeping seal of approval — should be tasked with holding data centers accountable for clean energy pledges.\\n\\n“Enforcement is a tricky problem,” he said. “What it boils down to is, are people holding true to their promises?”\\n\\nBoosting in-state solar capacity is far preferable to importing electricity because that might be sourced from states without a carbon emissions cap, Shobe said.\\n\\n“The question is how fast we can add renewable energy,” especially over the next five or six years, he said. “We are going to have to be more aggressive and do it faster if we are going to be a center for data center construction.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, the air board’s vote and the start of Virginia’s new, two-month legislative session has ushered in fresh fears that the state’s progress could be stymied. Shobe said he and other RGGI champions will meet with lawmakers to tout the climate value of sticking with the cap-and-invest program.\\n\\nWithdrawing from RGGI would halt the flow of auction allowances. Instead, in mid-December, Youngkin proposed replacing that with $200 million in taxpayer dollars dedicated to a Resilient Virginia Revolving Fund.\\n\\nThat shift away from the RGGI model signals a lack of commitment to tackling climate change, Shobe said, because it removes not only environmental certainty but also the incentive for utilities to pivot from high- to low-emitting generation.\\n\\nIn Virginia, he emphasized, the original reason for joining RGGI was about having a cost-effective tool for reducing emissions. Producing revenue was an afterthought.\\n\\n“If what the governor is hoping is that we will give up on achieving carbon dioxide reductions, that’s another matter,” Shobe said. “If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions, we need to be thinking ahead and asking ourselves what our energy portfolio is going to look like.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Emissions from electric power generation fell as renewable energy and natural gas displaced coal, which saw a small and short-lived increase in 2021 because of high natural gas prices. Natural gas is less carbon-intensive than coal, but its production and distribution releases methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas.\\n\\nA recent report from the International Energy Agency estimated that renewables are on track to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation worldwide by early 2025, as countries respond to fossil fuel supply disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine by enacting stronger policies to shift away from carbon-emitting oil, gas and coal.\\n\\nStill, the United States made little progress last year in either of its highest-emitting sectors, transportation and industry, which together account for roughly two-thirds of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial emissions rose by 1.5 percent and transportation emissions rose by 1.3 percent, the latter driven mainly by demand for jet fuel as air travel continued to recover from pandemic-era declines.\\n\\nSome experts are hopeful that provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act can provide money to help speed decarbonization at industrial plants and reduce fossil fuel emissions from heavy industry, including cement and steel production. The legislation also expanded consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, which typically create fewer emissions than gasoline-powered cars.\\n\\nThe most significant increase in emissions last year came from homes and buildings, which burn fossil fuels like natural gas in furnaces, hot water heaters and other appliances. Those emissions rose 6 percent, and reached prepandemic levels. Colder-than-average temperatures early in the year led many Americans to increase their home energy use by turning up the heat.\\n\\nThe estimates from the Rhodium Group’s sector by sector analysis do not include emissions from agriculture or from wildfires, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they burn forests and grasslands. Agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, with farming activities accounting for 11.2 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2020, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.',\n",

       "  'content': \"A new report from the Rhodium Group, a research firm that models greenhouse gas emissions, brings good news and bad news. First, the bad: U.S. emissions increased by just over 1 percent last year, making 2022 the second consecutive year of carbon emissions growth since the American economy began recovering from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe good news is that there are signs that the U.S. economy is already starting to kick its addiction to planet-warming emissions, even before the implementation of the landmark clean energy law passed by Congress last year. Although carbon emissions grew in 2022, the 1.3 percent year-over-year growth was far smaller than the 6.2 percent surge in 2021. More significantly, emissions didn’t rise as fast as overall economic output, indicating that the U.S. economy became less carbon-intensive even as it roared back to life after the 2020 lockdowns.\\n\\nThe main reason for this increasing divergence between economic growth and emissions growth is the decline of coal power, which is by far the most carbon-intensive form of electricity generation. As coal plants across the U.S. have shuttered over the past decade, natural gas plants have largely opened up to replace them. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, burning it produces around half the emissions that burning coal does.\\n\\nReader support helps sustain our work. Donate today to keep our climate news free.

Carbon-free power generation grew 12 percent in 2022, according to Rhodium, driven by the breakneck adoption of solar and wind. This growth came in spite of the fact that new solar deployments actually slowed down in 2022 as the industry grappled with snarls in the supply chain for polysilicon and other critical materials used to make solar panels. An ongoing squabble over tariffs on Chinese solar materials may further hamper the industry.\\n\\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\\n\\nEven so, the continued rollout of solar and wind facilities helped renewables overtake coal power in 2022, marking a major milestone in the energy transition. Solar, wind, and hydropower combined now account for around 22 percent of U.S. power generation, more than coal at 20 percent or nuclear at 19 percent, according to Rhodium. That hasn’t been the case in more than 60 years, ever since coal first surpassed hydropower.\\n\\nThe new data from Rhodium suggests that, despite the shocks of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the U.S. is on a long-term path toward a cleaner grid. The drop in power-sector emissions last year doesn’t reflect the potential effect of the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate law signed by President Biden last August, which provides extensive new tax credits for renewable energy as well as for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency. The first projects that benefit from the legislation aren’t expected to arrive until late 2023, but the subsidies will only further juice the current trend toward clean energy over the coming decade.\\n\\nLast year, as the United States emerged from the first wave of the pandemic, emissions grew faster than the economy did, thanks to a temporary resurgence in cheap coal and a huge jump in the number of automobile trips taken nationwide. Carbon pollution from the transportation and building sectors continued to rise this year, according to Rhodium’s data, reflecting the continued dominance of internal-combustion vehicles and gas heat. It was only in the power sector that emissions fell year-over-year.\\n\\nThat’s in keeping with a long-term trend. U.S. emissions have fallen by 15.5 percent since their peak in 2005, largely thanks to the slow death of coal power. It was a market-driven shift toward gas and renewables, rather than any climate-focused public policy, that spurred this reduction, but now the Inflation Reduction Act should help extend these gains to other segments of the economy, pushing the U.S. closer to meeting the goals of the 2016 Paris climate accords, in which the world’s countries collectively pledged to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\\n\\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\\n\\nThe report from Rhodium notes that federal policy, “together with additional policies from leading states as well as action from private actors, can put the [Paris] target within reach—but all parties must act quickly.” The report also says that the U.S. may see emissions fall as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as this year — “if the government can fast-track implementation.”\",\n",

       " 'content': 'Virginia’s participation in an East Coast greenhouse gas emissions pact is pivotal to curbing the climate impact of its thriving data center industry.\\n\\nGlobally, northern Virginia has become one of the largest data center hubs over the last decade-plus. Offering generous tax incentives has attracted tech giants eager to construct massive server farms with proximity to crucial digital infrastructure. An estimated 70% of the world’s internet traffic moves through the suburbs of Washington, D.C., daily.\\n\\nThat burgeoning has propelled a surge in electricity use. In 2020, the sector consumed close to 12,000 gigawatt-hours in Dominion Energy’s territory — roughly one-sixth of the investor-owned utility’s total retail sales that same year.\\n\\nAnd yet, the state’s carbon emissions from power plants have fallen 12% annually during the last two years.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe, an environmental policy professor at the University of Virginia, is among those crediting the 11-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Known as RGGI, the initiative is a voluntary carbon cap-and-invest venture designed to tamp down heat-trapping gases emitted by the utility sector. Virginia’s downward emissions trend will halt without that cap in place, Shobe said.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe Credit: University of Virginia\\n\\nEven as electricity-hungry data centers multiply across the state, RGGI’s binding carbon cap keeps emissions in check. Basically, the amount of fossil fuels a utility is allowed to burn shrinks each year as the cap is lowered.\\n\\nIt’s a crucial dynamic to understand, Shobe said, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has vowed to extract Virginia from the market-based climate initiative.\\n\\n“As a planetary citizen, I’m happy with that [cap],” said Shobe, who directs the Energy Transition Initiative at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. “If the state relaxes RGGI, then data centers have climate consequences that we need to worry about.”\\n\\nHe’s hopeful that legislators won’t follow Youngkin’s lead on RGGI during the session that opened last Wednesday. Republicans control the House of Delegates while Democrats have a majority in the Senate.\\n\\nShobe also argues that continuing to build data centers in Virginia can be a net positive for climate change — assuming data centers will be built somewhere and the state stays committed to the regional greenhouse gas program. That construction trend shows no signs of abating in Virginia for at least the next 10 years.\\n\\n“As long as we are a member of RGGI, then we should encourage data centers here rather than Ohio, Indiana or someplace else without a cap on carbon dioxide emissions,” Shobe said.\\n\\nShobe played a significant role in designing the mechanisms behind RGGI, which debuted in 2009. In a nutshell, each member state limits emissions from fossil fuel power plants, issues carbon dioxide allowances and sets up participation in auctions for those allowances.\\n\\nIn 2020, Virginia became the first Southern state to join RGGI, after ample back-and-forth bickering. Advocates have hailed the program for its climate benefits and the upward of $450 million the allowance auction has so far yielded for statewide flood resiliency projects, energy efficiency upgrades, and home repairs for low-income residents statewide.\\n\\nYoungkin has been itching to extract Virginia from RGGI since he took office a year ago. In early December, the state’s Air Pollution Control Board voted 4-1 to accelerate that exit.\\n\\nAttorneys with environmental organizations maintain that the Youngkin administration lacks the authority to leave the compact. That decision, RGGI proponents say, is in the hands of the General Assembly. A legislative effort to derail RGGI failed last year.\\n\\nThe air board’s initial vote to leave RGGI will trigger a 60-day comment period this winter. Shobe and his colleagues are prepared to weigh in with insights that the board will review before voting again on the proposal.\\n\\nShobe published an electricity use forecast in April 2021 predicting that data centers will be the driving force behind a 38% increase in electricity sales between 2020 and 2035. That equals an average increase in electricity use of around 44,000 gigawatt-hours per year.\\n\\n“Whether we think this is a good thing or not, data centers are growing very fast,” Shobe said. “Unfortunately, they use a lot of energy. How we provide that energy is what will make a difference.”\\n\\nShobe noted that residential electricity sales are close to flatlining due to slower population growth and improved energy efficiency. Likewise, commercial and industrial demand have fallen for several years.\\n\\nFor the most part, large technology companies have pledged to power their facilities with renewable energy. However, it’s unclear whether or how they are following through on those commitments.\\n\\nThus far, Virginia’s solar expansion is on pace with a legislative mandate to decarbonize the grid by 2050, Shobe said. But the state can’t afford a solar stumble if it’s going to feed the needs of voracious data centers.\\n\\nSome in the environmental community doubt that server farms will be able to live up to their vows to harness 100% of their energy from clean sources. Rooftop solar can’t cover those needs because the average solar array on a data center would only offset about 2.2% of its annual electricity consumption, according to calculations by solar developers.\\n\\nThat means operators resort to power purchase agreements, which allow them to go solar even if the utility-scale arrays they invest in are located miles away or in other states and might not be generating when data centers are consuming power.\\n\\nSome are leery of those pacts. But Shobe defends the agreements as “perfectly fine ways” to contain greenhouse gases.\\n\\n“If a data center has a solar farm built somewhere else to cover emissions, why wouldn’t you want to credit them for that?” he said, adding that his university does just that with two off-campus arrays. “From the point of view of resolving global warming, it doesn’t matter where it is built.\\n\\n“As long as it’s on the same planet, it has the same effect on emissions.”\\n\\nShobe suggested that in the big picture, a third-party monitoring organization — along the lines of a Good Housekeeping seal of approval — should be tasked with holding data centers accountable for clean energy pledges.\\n\\n“Enforcement is a tricky problem,” he said. “What it boils down to is, are people holding true to their promises?”\\n\\nBoosting in-state solar capacity is far preferable to importing electricity because that might be sourced from states without a carbon emissions cap, Shobe said.\\n\\n“The question is how fast we can add renewable energy,” especially over the next five or six years, he said. “We are going to have to be more aggressive and do it faster if we are going to be a center for data center construction.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, the air board’s vote and the start of Virginia’s new, two-month legislative session has ushered in fresh fears that the state’s progress could be stymied. Shobe said he and other RGGI champions will meet with lawmakers to tout the climate value of sticking with the cap-and-invest program.\\n\\nWithdrawing from RGGI would halt the flow of auction allowances. Instead, in mid-December, Youngkin proposed replacing that with $200 million in taxpayer dollars dedicated to a Resilient Virginia Revolving Fund.\\n\\nThat shift away from the RGGI model signals a lack of commitment to tackling climate change, Shobe said, because it removes not only environmental certainty but also the incentive for utilities to pivot from high- to low-emitting generation.\\n\\nIn Virginia, he emphasized, the original reason for joining RGGI was about having a cost-effective tool for reducing emissions. Producing revenue was an afterthought.\\n\\n“If what the governor is hoping is that we will give up on achieving carbon dioxide reductions, that’s another matter,” Shobe said. “If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions, we need to be thinking ahead and asking ourselves what our energy portfolio is going to look like.”',\n",

By unreasonably limiting Duke’s near-term procurement of clean, low-cost solar resources, the Commission’s order will increase costs for ratepayers and delay reductions in Duke’s carbon emissions.\\n\\nUnder landmark legislation passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2021, the Commission was required to adopt a plan for reducing Duke’s North Carolina carbon emissions by 70% (against 2005 levels) by 2030, unless the deadline is extended by the Commission under certain allowable circumstances.\\n\\nLast May, Duke filed a proposed Carbon Plan. It included several portfolios for achieving the required carbon reductions, but only one that would do so by 2030. Interested parties, including renewable energy suppliers, customer groups, environmental organizations, the North Carolina Attorney General, and the state’s consumer advocate, filed thousands of pages of comments and expert testimony on Duke’s plan. Our companies were active participants throughout the proceeding through our trade association, the Clean Power Suppliers Association.\\n\\nThe Commission held a three-week hearing in the fall, and on December 30 issued a 137-page order directing Duke to take a suite of 39 actions to begin reducing its carbon emissions and to continue and improve the planning process going forward.\\n\\nThe Commission’s order deals with a wide range of complex issues. However, at its core the order seeks to establish a comprehensive plan for retiring Duke’s expensive and dirty coal plants and replacing them with cleaner alternatives. The key question in the proceeding is what that alternative resource mix should look like to achieve 70% decarbonization in the least-cost manner while maintaining or improving system reliability, as required by the legislation.\\n\\nDuke and other parties presented a variety of resource “portfolios,” which included various combinations of new solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, battery storage and hydroelectric resources. In support of their alternative portfolios, commenters produced detailed modeling, developed by nationally recognized energy consulting firms. Many of the alternative portfolios presented could have achieved quicker emissions reductions than Duke’s, and at lower cost.\\n\\nThe Commission appropriately concluded that it’s not necessary to settle on a single portfolio now, and instead approved a series of steps to be taken over the next two years that are intended to make reasonable progress toward achieving the goal while keeping a wide range of portfolio options on the table.\\n\\nOne of the most important of those steps is the procurement of new solar resources by Duke. No party disputed that solar and solar-plus-storage are the most proven, affordable, and scalable zero-carbon generation resources available to Duke’s system. It was also undisputed that the least-cost pathway for achieving compliance with the decarbonization mandate while maintaining reliability would be to maximize solar additions in combination with other resources that provide power when the sun isn’t shining.\\n\\nCPSA’s expert witness documented that ratepayers could enjoy huge savings by adding substantially more solar than proposed by Duke, including $860 million of savings in 2030 alone, assuming conservative solar costs and not accounting for Inflation Reduction Act incentives. While our modeling showed the need for natural gas additions comparable to those proposed by Duke, it demonstrated that adding more solar would avoid the need to invest in more costly and uncertain zero-carbon resources like small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Other intervenors, including the Attorney General and its expert witnesses, reached similar conclusions.\\n\\nThe Commission ignored virtually all of this evidence and agreed with Duke that that it need only procure 3,100 MW of new solar through 2024. This is a bad outcome for ratepayers and for the goal of reducing Duke’s carbon emissions in a timely fashion while maintaining reliability.\\n\\nDuke claimed that the solar resources it is required to procure should be limited by the rate at which it thinks it can interconnect such resources to its system. The Commission declined to require Duke to test its ability to improve its interconnection rate by procuring and trying to interconnect more solar, arguing that doing so might require Duke to pay more for solar if prices come down over time. Leaving aside the uncertainty as to whether solar prices actually decline, this argument ignores the fact that failing to include more solar in the overall resource mix means that significantly more expensive resources will have to be procured instead.\\n\\nAlthough the Commission claims that it hasn’t given up on achieving H.B. 951’s decarbonization mandate by 2030, its refusal to require Duke to procure more solar through 2024 almost certainly makes 2030 compliance impossible. The Commission can correct this error, save ratepayers money, and expedite the required reduction in carbon emissions by adjusting the solar procurement volumes upward this year and next, by significantly increasing solar procurement volumes in the next iteration of the Carbon Plan, and by pushing Duke to investigate ways to improve its interconnection performance. We urge it to do so.\\n\\nSteven Levitas and Tyler Norris are co-chairs of the Clean Power Suppliers Association.

       " 'Around 6 o’clock on the evening of Friday, Dec. 30, when anyone who could be was mentally checked out for the holidays, the North Carolina Utilities Commission dropped one of its most important rulings of the last decade: The 137-page Carbon Plan, the commission’s directive to Duke Energy to drastically reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to do its part in thwarting a planetary crisis.\\n\\nHowever, many clean energy and environmental advocates quickly decried the plan as deferential to the utility. “Tragically, the NC Utilities Commission went along with Duke Energy’s massive, climate-wrecking fracked gas expansion,” Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, Duke’s perennial nemesis, wrote. “The commission also seemed to go along with Duke’s request to greatly limit new solar projects indefinitely pending billions in new – and likely controversial – transmission projects.”\\n\\nThese projects include small modular nuclear reactors, nascent hydrogen power technology and additional natural gas resources.\\n\\nThe plan is a requirement under House Bill 951, which Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law in October 2021. It directs the utilities commission to “take all reasonable steps” to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from Duke Energy’s electric generating facilities. The plan sets a goal of 70% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 – just seven years from now. And by 2050, Duke should have achieved carbon neutrality.\\n\\nThe commission has the flexibility to delay these benchmarks by up to two years or longer if nuclear or wind power requires more time to be built or to maintain the reliability of the grid.\\n\\nBut the planet is out of runway. Globally, the last eight years have been the warmest on record, according to data released this week by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Levels of carbon dioxide and methane continue to increase. “For both gases these are the highest concentrations from the satellite record,” the service reported, “and by including other records, the highest levels for over 2 million years for carbon dioxide and over 800,000 years for methane.”\\n\\nAnd three of Duke Energy’s proposals prepared in cooperation with Public Staff – the citizens’ representative body that advises the commission – would blow past the 2030 deadline. “While the Commission correctly decided not to decide now to extend the 2030 compliance requirement,” wrote the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented three clean energy groups in the proceedings, “it adopted the near-term actions proposed by Duke, which are based almost entirely on plans that miss that deadline.”\\n\\nThe Carbon Plan contains other loopholes the size of the Antarctic ozone layer. Environmental justice, for instance, gets short shrift, with just four paragraphs devoted to the issue at the end of the document, as if an epilogue.\\n\\nEnvironmental injustice is also baked into the rate disparities between Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas. Although Duke Energy owns both, the cost of electricity is “substantially higher” – by 19% – in Duke Energy Progress territory than Duke Energy Carolina, the report reads.\\n\\nPut another way, a household served by DEP that uses 1,000 kilowatt hours per month pays $125.94, while a household in DEC using the same amount of energy pays $106.23.\\n\\nThe DEP service area encompasses 36 entire counties, of which 21 are designated as Tier 1, by the state Department of Commerce as “most distressed” economically. Most DEP territory lies along and east of I-95.\\n\\nIn comparison, of the 31 counties wholly in DEC territory, just six are Tier 1.\\n\\n(DEP shares coverage with DEC in another dozen counties; three of which are most distressed.)\\n\\n“The rate difference has increased consistently since Duke and Progress merged in 2012,” the commission wrote in the plan. “This is in part because Duke Energy Progress has more solar and needed transmission and distribution upgrades.”\\n\\nTo address the rate disparity, the utilities commission directed that Duke plan to merge its two systems. This would also spread the costs of carbon reduction and new investments over a larger customer base.\\n\\nBecause of its geography – flat expanses of land – DEP territory will have most of the new solar projects, and customers there “will bear a disproportionate share of the costs to achieve statewide compliance,” the commission wrote.\\n\\nDuke is scheduled to present merger plans by its next interim Carbon Plan filing, no later than September of this year.\\n\\nHere is an overview of some of the energy sources, both fossil fuels and renewable power, that Duke will continue to employ in the coming years:\\n\\nNatural gas: Bridge fuel or planetary assassin?\\n\\nThe role of natural gas is “one of the most significant resource planning decisions in this proceeding,” the commission wrote.\\n\\nHowever, methane, the main component in natural gas, is a major driver of climate change. But methane is not accounted for in the plan. That is by design: House Bill 951 omitted any constraints on methane or natural gas. For its part, Duke countered in the plan that methane and carbon dioxide “are distinct chemical compounds and had the legislature wanted to include methane they would have done so.”\\n\\nDelaying new natural gas facilities would limit the utility’s ability to retire existing coal units, Duke claims. The postponement would reportedly increase carbon emissions by 2 million tons for just one delayed unit.\\n\\nWhile the commission did approve natural gas as part of its Carbon Plan, it cautioned this doesn’t mean it’s “approving the construction of a particular generating facility.”\\n\\nIn previous commission meetings and filings, Duke’s Modeling and Near-Term Actions Panel said natural gas would help “maintain reliability and quality of service.” Yet as North Carolinians now know, several natural gas and coal-fired power plants failed during last month’s cold snap, as instrumentation lines froze. To reduce the immense strain not only on the state grid, but the entire Eastern Interconnection, Duke had to inflict rolling blackouts on hundreds of thousands of customers on Christmas Eve.\\n\\nThere are also limitations on natural gas pipelines. Duke and Dominion canceled the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in 2020, citing enormous cost overruns and successful legal challenges to the project.\\n\\nThe Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is owned by a consortium of companies unrelated to Duke, is similarly stalled in Virginia, in part because of hundreds of environmental violations, thus jeopardizing its extension into North Carolina.\\n\\nDuke is assuming no natural gas will be available from the MVP extension, according to the plan. Even if that extension is built, it’s uncertain whether the gas can reach Duke Energy Carolinas territory.\\n\\nThe cost of natural gas is skyrocketing, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And Duke modeled its prices before Russia invaded Ukraine, which constricted supply. The dollar figures are “now significantly higher than Duke’s worst case scenario in its Carbon Plan proposal,” the NC Attorney General’s Office wrote.\\n\\nUpcoming dates of interest:\\n\\nDuke Energy Progress rate increase hearings. The utility is requesting a 17.7% hike. All hearings start at 7 p.m.\\n\\n* Monday, March 6 – Haywood County Courthouse, 285 N. Main St., Waynesville\\n\\n* Tuesday, March 13 – Person County Courthouse, 105 S. Main St., Roxboro\\n\\n* Wednesday, March 14 – Dobbs Building, 430 N. Salisbury St., Raleigh\\n\\n* Tuesday, March 20 – Greene County Courthouse, 301 N. Greene St., Snow Hill\\n\\n* Wednesday, March 21 – Robeson County Courthouse, 500 N. Elm St., Lumberton\\n\\nDuke is scheduled to file its interim Carbon Plan/Integrated Resource Plan no later than Sept. 1, 2023.\\n\\nThe Utilities Commission’s next installment of its approved Carbon Plan is due by Dec. 31, 2024.\\n\\nHere comes the sun — but it’s underwhelming\\n\\nThere is a limited amount of carbon-free (and methane-free) energy. Fortunately, North Carolina has a lot of it: the sun.\\n\\nWhen combined with battery storage – allowing Duke to tap into the energy when the sun isn’t shining – solar is the cleanest form of power available in the state.\\n\\nThe commission approved Duke’s proposed near-term plan, limiting new solar to 3,100 megawatts through 2024, the most the utility claims it can interconnect to its system over the next five years.\\n\\nAlternative proposals were more ambitious and, critics of the plan say, attainable.\\n\\nThe Clean Power Suppliers Association wrote that 3,100 megawatts of near-term solar procurement is inconsistent with Duke’s own 2030 compliance portfolio, which requires 5,400 megawatts of solar to be online by the beginning of 2030. By lowballing the amount, “the Commission has made it extremely difficult” to achieve that target, CPSA wrote.\\n\\nHowever, the public staff contended that that figure was unrealistic because of Duke’s transmission limits and costs. The staff contended “there must be an orderly transition from fossil fuel resources to renewable resources” and faults the Clean Power Suppliers Association and its contracted modeling” for not factoring in greater costs.\\n\\nRead about some of the transmission challenges that confront North Carolina and the nation here, here and here.\\n\\nWind: It’s complicated\\n\\nUnlike Iowa and Texas, where thousands of wind turbines dot their flat landscapes, North Carolina has just two onshore farms: A 208-megawatt facility in Perquimans and Pasquotank counties owned by Amazon and the planned 189-megawatt facility in Chowan County, known as Timbermill. Both are in PJM territory, a regional transmission organization, and outside of Duke’s service area.\\n\\n(A previous 18-month state moratorium on wind energy ended in December 2018. Trumpeted by former Sen. Harry Brown, a coastal Republican, the moratorium delayed the Timbermill project, and derailed progress on developing this renewable resource.)\\n\\nIt’s unlikely that any onshore facility would be built in Duke’s territory until at least 2029, and even then there are hurdles to clear. First, Carteret County has the greatest onshore wind potential, but it also lies within military flight paths, which complicates turbine siting. State law prohibits turbines on mountain ridges, so most blustery western regions are also off-limits.\\n\\nDuke also has transmission constraints in parts of eastern North Carolina. That bottleneck is already limiting the amount of solar that can be passed on to other parts of the state. To accommodate wind power, Duke would have to significantly ramp up its transmission lines.\\n\\nFor off-shore wind, the prospects are better, although these are long-term plans.\\n\\nIn 2017 Avangrid leased federal waters 27 miles offshore of Kitty Hawk, where it plans to build a 2,500-megawatt farm. Transmission requires the installation of undersea cables, and the current route burrows beneath the Pamlico Sound, which is likely a deal breaker. In that case, Avangrid would have to connect onshore at Virginia Beach, adding 100 miles and $350 million to the cost.\\n\\nPresident Biden revoked the Trump administration’s 10-year moratorium on offshore wind leasing in the Southeast, including North Carolina. After the temporary ban was lifted, Duke Energy Renewables Wind successfully bid $155 million for 55,000 acres off Carolina Long Beach in Brunswick County. Total Energies, a French company, won a separate lease in the area.\\n\\nDuke has to provide a site assessment to federal officials by June, with a construction and operations plan due in late 2026 or mid-2027.\\n\\nConsidering the eight to 10 years typically required for an offshore wind farm to begin commercial operation, the utilities commission determined that this is a long-term solution, but not a near-term one.\\n\\nThe nuclear option\\n\\nDuke is asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend its license for the existing nuclear plants in North Carolina: Brunswick, Shearon Harris and McGuire.\\n\\nThe utility is also investigating the feasibility of small modular nuclear reactors. Small nuclear reactors are about a third of the size of a typical nuclear power plant. They are housed underground and can be built more quickly and cheaply than traditional reactors.\\n\\nAn early version of House Bill 951 allowed Duke to incur as much as $50 million for an early site permit from the NRC. That provision was later stripped from the measure.\\n\\nHowever, none of these small reactors currently operate in the U.S. NuScale, which builds the reactors, plans to deliver its first one to Utah in 2027. It’s not expected to go online until 2029. Even in its infancy that project has already come in well over budget — from $3 billion to $6 billion, according to a 2020 article in Scientific American.\\n\\nOpponents also question their safety, especially in areas prone to flooding and earthquakes, as well as the disposal of nuclear waste.\\n\\nScientific American also reported that the NRC itself had safety concerns. One engineer discussed “boron dilution,” which means “that even if a reactor is shut down, fission reactions could restart and begin a dangerous power increase.”\\n\\nSome clean energy advocates also opposed this technology in the Carbon Plan because it is “unproven and expensive, and will generate nuclear waste.”\\n\\nEven Duke acknowledged these reactors are “not a mature technology and none is commercially operating.” To ramp one up by 2032 is an “aggressive schedule,” the plan reads.\\n\\nWho pays for the Carbon Plan?\\n\\nDuke wants to pass costs of the Carbon Plan along to ratepayers for its initial project development work for the following projects: new nuclear facilities, offshore wind, and pumped hydroelectric power. Current state law allows this early cost recovery only for nuclear plants. (It’s known as CWIP: Construction Work in Progress.)\\n\\nDuke warned that without some money upfront, it “may not pursue some resources.”\\n\\nThe utility has ample money to pay its top people. CEO Lynn Good raked in nearly $81.5 million between 2017 and 2021, according to a report released this week by the Energy and Policy Institute, a national watchdog group.\\n\\nDuke’s pricing models did not include hefty tax cuts for energy producers that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the act in August, after Duke had completed its modeling.\\n\\nOther federal actions could also alter costs and the overall marketplace. For example, the EPA is scheduled to propose its revised Clean Power Plan in March. The agency also issued a proposal in November that would further limit methane emissions from natural gas operations.\\n\\nThat said, the utilities commission did approve Duke’s proposal to spend roughly $72 million to investigate nuclear power possibilities.\\n\\nBut in general, the commission declined to rule on “cost reasonableness and the prudence of Carbon Plan execution costs until formally presented at a hearing,” it wrote. “This is not a preapproval of cost recovery.”\\n\\nDuke, not surprisingly, supported the Carbon Plan, as the utility received much of what it requested from the commission.\\n\\n“We believe this is a constructive outcome that advances our clean energy transition, supporting a diverse, ‘all of the above’ approach that is essential for long-term resource planning,” the utility said in a prepared statement.\\n\\nClean energy advocates, though, felt deflated by the timidity of the plan, calling the order “disappointing.”\\n\\nJoel Porter, policy director of CleanAIRE NC, said that while the plan includes “many commendable provisions,” it will likely miss the 2030 targets as set out in House Bill 951. “We have to be serious about lowering emissions,” Porter said.\\n\\nThat point was underscored by NOAA this week. The climate crisis is increasing the chances of extreme weather, such as floods, wildfires and heatwaves. In the first 10 days of 2023, the California coast was drowned in relentless floods. And in Europe, seven countries reported all-time record highs, where mid-winter has been as warm as summer.\\n\\nRepublish',\n",
       " 'Virginia’s participation in an East Coast greenhouse gas emissions pact is pivotal to curbing the climate impact of its thriving data center industry.\\n\\nGlobally, northern Virginia has become one of the largest data center hubs over the last decade-plus. Offering generous tax incentives has attracted tech giants eager to construct massive server farms with proximity to crucial digital infrastructure. An estimated 70% of the world’s internet traffic moves through the suburbs of Washington, D.C., daily.\\n\\nThat burgeoning has propelled a surge in electricity use. In 2020, the sector consumed close to 12,000 gigawatt-hours in Dominion Energy’s territory — roughly one-sixth of the investor-owned utility’s total retail sales that same year.\\n\\nAnd yet, the state’s carbon emissions from power plants have fallen 12% annually during the last two years.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe, an environmental policy professor at the University of Virginia, is among those crediting the 11-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Known as RGGI, the initiative is a voluntary carbon cap-and-invest venture designed to tamp down heat-trapping gases emitted by the utility sector. Virginia’s downward emissions trend will halt without that cap in place, Shobe said.\\n\\nWilliam Shobe Credit: University of Virginia\\n\\nEven as electricity-hungry data centers multiply across the state, RGGI’s binding carbon cap keeps emissions in check. Basically, the amount of fossil fuels a utility is allowed to burn shrinks each year as the cap is lowered.\\n\\nIt’s a crucial dynamic to understand, Shobe said, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has vowed to extract Virginia from the market-based climate initiative.\\n\\n“As a planetary citizen, I’m happy with that [cap],” said Shobe, who directs the Energy Transition Initiative at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. “If the state relaxes RGGI, then data centers have climate consequences that we need to worry about.”\\n\\nHe’s hopeful that legislators won’t follow Youngkin’s lead on RGGI during the session that opened last Wednesday. Republicans control the House of Delegates while Democrats have a majority in the Senate.\\n\\nShobe also argues that continuing to build data centers in Virginia can be a net positive for climate change — assuming data centers will be built somewhere and the state stays committed to the regional greenhouse gas program. That construction trend shows no signs of abating in Virginia for at least the next 10 years.\\n\\n“As long as we are a member of RGGI, then we should encourage data centers here rather than Ohio, Indiana or someplace else without a cap on carbon dioxide emissions,” Shobe said.\\n\\nShobe played a significant role in designing the mechanisms behind RGGI, which debuted in 2009. In a nutshell, each member state limits emissions from fossil fuel power plants, issues carbon dioxide allowances and sets up participation in auctions for those allowances.\\n\\nIn 2020, Virginia became the first Southern state to join RGGI, after ample back-and-forth bickering. Advocates have hailed the program for its climate benefits and the upward of $450 million the allowance auction has so far yielded for statewide flood resiliency projects, energy efficiency upgrades, and home repairs for low-income residents statewide.\\n\\nYoungkin has been itching to extract Virginia from RGGI since he took office a year ago. In early December, the state’s Air Pollution Control Board voted 4-1 to accelerate that exit.\\n\\nAttorneys with environmental organizations maintain that the Youngkin administration lacks the authority to leave the compact. That decision, RGGI proponents say, is in the hands of the General Assembly. A legislative effort to derail RGGI failed last year.\\n\\nThe air board’s initial vote to leave RGGI will trigger a 60-day comment period this winter. Shobe and his colleagues are prepared to weigh in with insights that the board will review before voting again on the proposal.\\n\\nShobe published an electricity use forecast in April 2021 predicting that data centers will be the driving force behind a 38% increase in electricity sales between 2020 and 2035. That equals an average increase in electricity use of around 44,000 gigawatt-hours per year.\\n\\n“Whether we think this is a good thing or not, data centers are growing very fast,” Shobe said. “Unfortunately, they use a lot of energy. How we provide that energy is what will make a difference.”\\n\\nShobe noted that residential electricity sales are close to flatlining due to slower population growth and improved energy efficiency. Likewise, commercial and industrial demand have fallen for several years.\\n\\nFor the most part, large technology companies have pledged to power their facilities with renewable energy. However, it’s unclear whether or how they are following through on those commitments.\\n\\nThus far, Virginia’s solar expansion is on pace with a legislative mandate to decarbonize the grid by 2050, Shobe said. But the state can’t afford a solar stumble if it’s going to feed the needs of voracious data centers.\\n\\nSome in the environmental community doubt that server farms will be able to live up to their vows to harness 100% of their energy from clean sources. Rooftop solar can’t cover those needs because the average solar array on a data center would only offset about 2.2% of its annual electricity consumption, according to calculations by solar developers.\\n\\nThat means operators resort to power purchase agreements, which allow them to go solar even if the utility-scale arrays they invest in are located miles away or in other states and might not be generating when data centers are consuming power.\\n\\nSome are leery of those pacts. But Shobe defends the agreements as “perfectly fine ways” to contain greenhouse gases.\\n\\n“If a data center has a solar farm built somewhere else to cover emissions, why wouldn’t you want to credit them for that?” he said, adding that his university does just that with two off-campus arrays. “From the point of view of resolving global warming, it doesn’t matter where it is built.\\n\\n“As long as it’s on the same planet, it has the same effect on emissions.”\\n\\nShobe suggested that in the big picture, a third-party monitoring organization — along the lines of a Good Housekeeping seal of approval — should be tasked with holding data centers accountable for clean energy pledges.\\n\\n“Enforcement is a tricky problem,” he said. “What it boils down to is, are people holding true to their promises?”\\n\\nBoosting in-state solar capacity is far preferable to importing electricity because that might be sourced from states without a carbon emissions cap, Shobe said.\\n\\n“The question is how fast we can add renewable energy,” especially over the next five or six years, he said. “We are going to have to be more aggressive and do it faster if we are going to be a center for data center construction.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, the air board’s vote and the start of Virginia’s new, two-month legislative session has ushered in fresh fears that the state’s progress could be stymied. Shobe said he and other RGGI champions will meet with lawmakers to tout the climate value of sticking with the cap-and-invest program.\\n\\nWithdrawing from RGGI would halt the flow of auction allowances. Instead, in mid-December, Youngkin proposed replacing that with $200 million in taxpayer dollars dedicated to a Resilient Virginia Revolving Fund.\\n\\nThat shift away from the RGGI model signals a lack of commitment to tackling climate change, Shobe said, because it removes not only environmental certainty but also the incentive for utilities to pivot from high- to low-emitting generation.\\n\\nIn Virginia, he emphasized, the original reason for joining RGGI was about having a cost-effective tool for reducing emissions. Producing revenue was an afterthought.\\n\\n“If what the governor is hoping is that we will give up on achieving carbon dioxide reductions, that’s another matter,” Shobe said. “If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions, we need to be thinking ahead and asking ourselves what our energy portfolio is going to look like.”',\n",
       " 'Emissions from electric power generation fell as renewable energy and natural gas displaced coal, which saw a small and short-lived increase in 2021 because of high natural gas prices. Natural gas is less carbon-intensive than coal, but its production and distribution releases methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas.\\n\\nA recent report from the International Energy Agency estimated that renewables are on track to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation worldwide by early 2025, as countries respond to fossil fuel supply disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine by enacting stronger policies to shift away from carbon-emitting oil, gas and coal.\\n\\nStill, the United States made little progress last year in either of its highest-emitting sectors, transportation and industry, which together account for roughly two-thirds of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial emissions rose by 1.5 percent and transportation emissions rose by 1.3 percent, the latter driven mainly by demand for jet fuel as air travel continued to recover from pandemic-era declines.\\n\\nSome experts are hopeful that provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act can provide money to help speed decarbonization at industrial plants and reduce fossil fuel emissions from heavy industry, including cement and steel production. The legislation also expanded consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, which typically create fewer emissions than gasoline-powered cars.\\n\\nThe most significant increase in emissions last year came from homes and buildings, which burn fossil fuels like natural gas in furnaces, hot water heaters and other appliances. Those emissions rose 6 percent, and reached prepandemic levels. Colder-than-average temperatures early in the year led many Americans to increase their home energy use by turning up the heat.\\n\\nThe estimates from the Rhodium Group’s sector by sector analysis do not include emissions from agriculture or from wildfires, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they burn forests and grasslands. Agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, with farming activities accounting for 11.2 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2020, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.',\n",
       " \"A new report from the Rhodium Group, a research firm that models greenhouse gas emissions, brings good news and bad news. First, the bad: U.S. emissions increased by just over 1 percent last year, making 2022 the second consecutive year of carbon emissions growth since the American economy began recovering from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe good news is that there are signs that the U.S. economy is already starting to kick its addiction to planet-warming emissions, even before the implementation of the landmark clean energy law passed by Congress last year. Although carbon emissions grew in 2022, the 1.3 percent year-over-year growth was far smaller than the 6.2 percent surge in 2021. More significantly, emissions didn’t rise as fast as overall economic output, indicating that the U.S. economy became less carbon-intensive even as it roared back to life after the 2020 lockdowns.\\n\\nThe main reason for this increasing divergence between economic growth and emissions growth is the decline of coal power, which is by far the most carbon-intensive form of electricity generation. As coal plants across the U.S. have shuttered over the past decade, natural gas plants have largely opened up to replace them. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, burning it produces around half the emissions that burning coal does.\\n\\nReader support helps sustain our work. Donate today to keep our climate news free.

Carbon-free power generation grew 12 percent in 2022, according to Rhodium, driven by the breakneck adoption of solar and wind. This growth came in spite of the fact that new solar deployments actually slowed down in 2022 as the industry grappled with snarls in the supply chain for polysilicon and other critical materials used to make solar panels. An ongoing squabble over tariffs on Chinese solar materials may further hamper the industry.\\n\\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\\n\\nEven so, the continued rollout of solar and wind facilities helped renewables overtake coal power in 2022, marking a major milestone in the energy transition. Solar, wind, and hydropower combined now account for around 22 percent of U.S. power generation, more than coal at 20 percent or nuclear at 19 percent, according to Rhodium. That hasn’t been the case in more than 60 years, ever since coal first surpassed hydropower.\\n\\nThe new data from Rhodium suggests that, despite the shocks of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the U.S. is on a long-term path toward a cleaner grid. The drop in power-sector emissions last year doesn’t reflect the potential effect of the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate law signed by President Biden last August, which provides extensive new tax credits for renewable energy as well as for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency. The first projects that benefit from the legislation aren’t expected to arrive until late 2023, but the subsidies will only further juice the current trend toward clean energy over the coming decade.\\n\\nLast year, as the United States emerged from the first wave of the pandemic, emissions grew faster than the economy did, thanks to a temporary resurgence in cheap coal and a huge jump in the number of automobile trips taken nationwide. Carbon pollution from the transportation and building sectors continued to rise this year, according to Rhodium’s data, reflecting the continued dominance of internal-combustion vehicles and gas heat. It was only in the power sector that emissions fell year-over-year.\\n\\nThat’s in keeping with a long-term trend. U.S. emissions have fallen by 15.5 percent since their peak in 2005, largely thanks to the slow death of coal power. It was a market-driven shift toward gas and renewables, rather than any climate-focused public policy, that spurred this reduction, but now the Inflation Reduction Act should help extend these gains to other segments of the economy, pushing the U.S. closer to meeting the goals of the 2016 Paris climate accords, in which the world’s countries collectively pledged to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\\n\\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist.

       " 'I often write about 24/7 carbon free energy (CFE) — the concept of matching energy use with clean energy supply in real time. I find it endlessly fascinating: it is technically feasible, incredibly difficult and critical to decarbonization. That mix of urgency and complexity has stoked friendly competition between corporate climate leaders such as Google and Microsoft, making the conditions right for breakthroughs.\\n\\nOne of the largest barriers to decarbonizing power is cost. Our cheapest sources of energy — solar and wind — are weather dependent, meaning they must be partnered with more expensive, firm technologies, such as energy storage or geothermal, to meet our energy needs all day, every day.\\n\\nBut Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE), a local utility in northern California, is challenging that assumption. Using a new modeling tool called MATCH (a backronym for Matching Around-The-Clock Hourly Energy), PCE says it has a path to cost competitive, carbon-free energy by 2025.\\n\\nThe utility found it is able to reach clean energy 99 percent of the time at a price point that is only 2 percent more than just procuring enough renewable energy to offset their annual electricity consumption — a far less ambitious and far more common goal from companies and municipalities.\\n\\nHow will a local utility reach 24/7 CFE — without breaking the bank?\\n\\nReaching 24/7 CFE on a large scale will require a variety of tools, including load shaping and shifting to demand better match when energy is generated. Peninsula Clean Energy, which is trying to reach this goal in two short years, isn’t relying on customers to adopt new technologies or change behaviors.\\n\\nInstead, its model relies on overbuilding renewable capacity, which it says will leave very few hours where there is not enough supply to meet demand. To meet needs 99 percent of the time, the utility predicts it will need about 50 percent excess capacity, according to calculations spelled out in a white paper. It also assumes it can resell excess energy for resource adequacy or as renewable energy credits.\\n\\nGetting that last 1 percent, however, appears to be much more costly, requiring PCE to build 80 percent excess capacity. My 2 cents: 99 percent is pretty dang good, and, if every organization followed suit, would position us well to achieve climate goals.\\n\\nOf course, these findings are highly specific to Peninsula Clean Energy. The utility enjoys the temperate weather of the Bay Area, meaning there isn’t much demand for air conditioning in the summer or heaters in the winter. The modeling also focuses on just one year — 2025 — and costs will ultimately be dictated by market conditions. The calculations also assume the technologies will be available and deployments will happen on time.\\n\\nBut the findings challenge the notion that reaching 24/7 CFE will always be prohibitively expensive. And the new open source tool invites companies with deep decarbonization goals to game it out. So — what’s stopping you?',\n",
       " 'CHAPEL HILL, N.C.— Clean energy groups involved in the North Carolina Utilities Commission proceeding to develop a state plan to reduce heat-trapping carbon emissions from electricity generation–known as the Carbon Plan–said the plan released today by the commission risks missing the bipartisan legislative mandate of 70% emissions reductions from the power sector by 2030, and allows Duke to plan to rely on new polluting, costly gas instead of putting North Carolina on a “no regrets” path focused on clean energy. Gas has proven to be a main driver of recent increases to our electric bills as the cost of that volatile commodity is passed directly to customers.\\n\\nSeventy percent reduction of carbon pollution by 2030 is achievable for North Carolina while meeting its energy needs according to experts through increased investments in bill-saving energy efficiency and more renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy. The coalition of clean energy groups—the Natural Resources Defense Council, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and the Sierra Club, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, jointly with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association filed an expert’s plan at the commission that would reach the carbon mandates on time and at lower cost than Duke Energy’s own proposed plans.\\n\\nIn contrast, three of the four portfolios originally proposed by Duke Energy planned do not to meet the 2030 carbon pollution reduction deadline and all additional portfolios that Duke prepared in cooperation with the Public Staff also planned not to meet the 2030 deadline. While the Commission correctly decided not to decide now to extend the 2030 compliance requirement, it adopted the near-term actions proposed by Duke, which are based almost entirely on plans that miss that deadline.\\n\\nExpert analysis showed that North Carolina does not need to rely on speculative new technologies or the addition of any new fossil infrastructure, including any new gas. To the contrary, the Inflation Reduction Act recently signed into law by President Biden will significantly reduce the cost of zero-emission resources like wind and solar, resulting in dramatic expansion of those resources and reduction in power-sector emissions. The implications for the 2022 Carbon Plan are clear: with the price of clean energy poised to drop even further, going clean is the smarter plan. Fossil fuel-burning resources will become even more expensive relative to clean energy sources and will need to be retired early, at even greater cost.\\n\\n“North Carolina can meet state carbon-reduction goals on time and in a cleaner and more affordable way than suggested by Duke Energy and endorsed by the Commission. Expert modeling shows a no-regrets pathway that would have better fostered the growth of our clean energy economy and created a healthier environment for North Carolinians,” said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center which represents the Natural Resources Defense Council, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and the Sierra Club. “Relying more on low-cost renewable energy and treating energy efficiency as a priority resource would have positioned North Carolina to take full advantage of the cost-savings made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act and continue to make our grid stronger and more reliable, all while costing less on customer bills than Duke’s proposals.”\\n\\n“From the beginning, our team, along with our partners at the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and Sierra Club, have advocated for a carbon plan that meets the intent of House Bill 951 to reduce electricity-related emissions by 70% by 2030 in a cost-effective manner for ratepayers,” said Taylor Jones, regulatory counsel, NC Sustainable Energy Association. “We hope this order does just that, while improving resiliency and creating new economic opportunities for North Carolinians. Over the coming days and weeks, our team will evaluate the order to determine how it will impact electricity generation in NC for decades to come',\n",

       " 'By year’s end, North Carolina regulators will issue their plan for how Duke Energy should zero out its carbon emissions, shaping the profile of the Charlotte-based utility’s electricity generation over the next three decades.\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the release of the Carbon Plan — a requirement of a bipartisan state law that passed last year — the Energy News Network is spotlighting some of its most hotly contested aspects.\\n\\nEarlier this month, we explored how advocates believe Duke should double down on solar and examined the company’s controversial bid for a new generation of gas plants. Last week, we homed on energy efficiency.\\n\\nToday, our focus is wind power, especially offshore. While ocean-based turbines hold tremendous promise for delivering carbon-free electrons, bringing them online can take a decade or more, and their high costs cut against state regulators’ mandate to achieve a least-cost pathway to net zero.\\n\\n‘A proven technology’\\n\\nNorth Carolina is home to the Southeast’s first and largest land-based wind farm: over 100 turbines scattered across farmland near the Virginia border that supply Amazon data centers. A second project is in the permitting stage and could begin delivering power at the end of next year.\\n\\nYet by far, most of the excitement around wind power in the state is offshore.\\n\\nEnormous turbines with towers 30 stories high can harness more energy than their land-based counterparts and have the potential to power the state many times over. Ocean winds that blow most powerfully in winter mornings and summer evenings can serve as a perfect complement to solar panels that aren’t productive in those hours.\\n\\nAnd while U.S. Energy Information Administration data show offshore wind is among the most expensive forms of energy today, those costs are expected to plunge as more specialty parts like cables and blades are produced in the United States rather than shipped from overseas. The local manufacture and assembly of these components could also create vast economic opportunities.\\n\\nThat’s part of why Gov. Roy Cooper, a second-term Democrat who helped draft the law requiring the Carbon Plan, has made promoting offshore wind a priority. Last June, he issued an executive order calling for 2.8 gigawatts of wind energy off the North Carolina coast by 2030 and 8 gigawatts by 2040 — enough to power 2.3 million homes.\\n\\nYet, of the four pathways Duke proposed for carbon neutrality, none come close to these levels. The company’s most aggressive pursuit of offshore wind shows 1.6 gigawatts by 2032 and 3.2 gigawatts by 2050. Two pathways show just 800 megawatts by midcentury. And one, which heavily relies on the build-out of small nuclear reactors, shows zero.\\n\\nIt wasn’t just Duke. Synapse Energy Economics, which modeled alternative pathways to net zero carbon for a coalition of clean energy advocates, also showed a maximum of 800 megawatts of offshore wind by 2050. The results show the difficulty of projecting costs well into the future, said Tyler Fitch, a senior associate at Synapse who performed the modeling.\\n\\n“We have good reason to think that as the technology matures, and deployment matures, we will see more economic offshore wind,” Fitch said. “But with so little data, it’s difficult to project the cost trajectory and the availability.”\\n\\nKatharine Kollins, the president of the Southeastern Wind Coalition, acknowledges that, for now, the high price of offshore wind works against it in the Carbon Plan. But, she adds, that’s partly because ocean-based turbines are compared to not-yet commercially available resources like hydrogen and small nuclear reactors.\\n\\n“There’s just such a huge question mark on those technologies, where there’s not on offshore wind,” Kollins said. “We know that offshore wind is a proven technology. We know that it adds a lot of value to the grid.”\\n\\n‘Planning to build out these resources’\\n\\nThe Carbon Plan is due to be refreshed in 2024 and every two years after that, and offshore wind proponents believe the economics will keep getting better such that more and more can be included with each iteration. The question, they say, is what should be done now to prepare.\\n\\n“Let’s make sure we’re planning to build out all of these resources that we know are going to be needed,” Kollins said.\\n\\nWind developer TotalEnergies is the most aggressive on this score. The wind energy area known as Carolina Long Bay could represent between 2 and 3 gigawatts of capacity, according to the company, which owns half of the parcel, about 20 miles off the state’s southern coast.\\n\\n“It is reasonable to select and set a development goal of 2.8 gigawatts for the long-term resource class of offshore wind production by 2030,” says Total in its proposed order to utilities commissioners. Duke, the company proposes, should “plan its transmission facilities to receive and transmit the output equivalent to 2.8 GW of offshore wind generation.”\\n\\nDuke, whose unregulated renewables company owns the other half of Carolina Long Bay, is focused almost exclusively on that parcel, arguing that it should take ownership of the lease and begin developing it apace. “The proposed path does not foreclose other options,” the company says in its proposed order, “rather it ensures [we] will have at least one offshore wind project available in the 2024 Carbon Plan update.”\\n\\nAdvocates and the clean energy industry, however, question whether the Carolina Long Bay area is the quickest, cheapest route to offshore wind energy. Two wind energy areas off the coast of Kitty Hawk, owned by Avangrid Renewables since 2017, have higher wind speeds and are further along in the process. The groups advocate an independent study to evaluate all three areas in the near term.\\n\\n“There is insufficient information in the record to determine the relative overall value propositions for ratepayers presented by each of three Carolinas offshore wind lease areas,” a coalition of clean energy nonprofits and industry associations write in their joint proposed order. After the study is complete, they argue, the commission should “endeavor to issue an order prioritizing wind lease areas” that can meet the 2021 law’s interim target of cutting carbon emissions 70% by 2030.\\n\\nThe limits of onshore wind in the Carolinas\\n\\nWhen it comes to land-based wind turbines, Duke and a variety of stakeholders agree on at least one point: The potential in the Carolinas is limited.\\n\\nThe highest wind speeds are on the western ridge tops, where a 1983 law is widely believed to disallow turbines. The next best option is in the state’s northeast corner, but it’s the one patch of the state in PJM territory and not Duke’s transmission network, and “wheeling” the power to the company costs more money.\\n\\nThe state’s lower coastal plain presents some opportunities, but rules against tall structures interfering with the ubiquitous military operations in the area loom large. Plus, a 2013 state law imposes stringent permitting rules on top of local ones, and small but spirited numbers of wind opponents persist.\\n\\nIn its four pathways to net zero carbon pollution by midcentury, Duke proposes between 1.7 and 1.8 gigawatts of onshore wind in the Carolinas. In the short term, the company wants to procure 600 megawatts that would come online by the start of 2030. Environmental advocates produced similar figures but suggested a more aggressive near-term target of 900 megawatts.\\n\\n“While there likely are some limitations on the total amount of available onshore wind resources in the Carolinas over the next several years,” the clean energy industry and nonprofits write in their joint proposed order, “that limit should not be predetermined at this time.”\\n\\nFar more contentious than in-state onshore wind is the question of electricity imported from Texas and the Midwest, where wind power is abundant and cheap. Environmental advocates, state Attorney General Josh Stein, and other intervenors argue ratepayers could save billions of dollars if Duke was allowed to buy wind power from these regions, just as it buys power from outside the Carolinas now.\\n\\nBut Duke is adamant that the 2021 law dictates that it own all resources “selected” as part of the plan, with the exception of some solar and solar paired with storage. The company did consider importing its own wind resources into North Carolina, spokesperson Bill Norton said, but it was not economically chosen by its models until the mid- to late 2030s, and only in some portfolios.\\n\\n“We remain open to the possibility that importing onshore wind may be advantageous in the future,” Norton said, “but it is not part of our planned near-term actions.”',\n",

And from January 14 to 15, many of them gathered at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Forum to lay out their solutions and call for urgent collaboration on improving energy security and accelerating progress toward climate goals.\\n\\nBelow are highlights from the event, hosted by the Global Energy Center in partnership with the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure as part of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, and featuring leaders such as COP28 President-Designate Sultan Al Jaber and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.\\n\\nExplore the full event\\n\\nThe latest from Abu Dhabi\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 8:30 AM WASHINGTON | 5:30 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nEuropean energy commissioner: Stronger green targets are coming amid gas supply challenges\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\n“Both our presidents are willing to invest a lot to keep [the] transatlantic relationship,” said Kadri Simson, the European Commission’s commissioner for energy, as she brought a message of unity and optimism to close out the Atlantic Council 2023 Global Energy Forum.\\n\\nSpeaking with Richard Morningstar, founding chairman of the Council’s Global Energy Center and former US ambassador to the European Union (EU), Simson addressed how the past year has endangered the bloc’s energy and economic security in ways unseen in decades because of Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. Simson explained that the EU’s rapid action to reduce its natural gas consumption, efforts to grow renewable power capacity wherever possible, and support of diverse suppliers of liquefied natural gas (particularly the United States) enabled the bloc to pull through this winter. Though she acknowledged that the winter ahead could be even more challenging, she noted that “2022 was an extraordinary year for our renewable production… and targets for next year are even higher.” Renewable energy expansion via the REPowerEU strategy surpassed all expectations.\\n\\nShe thus rejected the notion that the EU has abandoned the “Green Deal” and countered that the bloc is negotiating even stronger green targets right now. She also rejected the idea that the price cap on Russian seaborne oil, coordinated with the Group of Seven (G7) nations, was ineffectual at sixty dollars per barrel, saying the evidence suggests that Russia is selling oil at discounts well below this number. She added that she hopes to never have to trigger the newly developed natural gas pricing mechanism.\\n\\nSimson was cooler, however, on the issue of the US Inflation Reduction Act—a source of mounting tensions throughout late 2022 over its perceived nationalistic provisions. She reasserted that the transatlantic relationship remains robust to the benefit of both sides and that any issues around unfair competition in the law can be solved through the existing EU-US working group on this issue. Her remarks suggested that, whatever 2023 may bring, Europe is fully prepared to weather the storm—and will do so alongside its friends and allies.\\n\\n🧵 At the #ACEnergyForum in Abu Dhabi, 🇪🇺 Commissioner for Energy @KadriSimson explains Europe’s three-pillar strategy to get rid of its dangerous dependence on Russian fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first pillar is to diversify supply routes.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more: ➡️ https://t.co/pE56Irkjte pic.twitter.com/P56w7FoVIM — Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) January 15, 2023\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 7:15 AM WASHINGTON | 4:15 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nTackling the biggest challenges for critical minerals supply chains—capacity, resiliency, and sustainability\\n\\nAs clean energy technologies proliferate, demand is soaring for critical minerals—but there is a two trillion dollar investment gap over the next fifteen years to finance supply chains for minerals needed to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

It may be too early to tell, but there are plenty of potential end uses for the fuel that point to the fuel’s role in the long term, said a panel of private-sector hydrogen experts at the Global Energy Forum on Sunday.\\n\\nBoth Meg Gentle, executive director of High Impact Fuels, and Shuayb Ismail, associate partner and head of partnerships at Xynteo, agreed that hydrogen and e-fuels are not future visions; rather, these are usable fuels right available now with vast decarbonization potential in the right conditions. Gentle discussed her company’s work in Chile producing “drop-in” e-fuels suitable for a variety of vehicles, both land and seaborne. High Impact Fuels’ facility in Chile is powered entirely by wind energy resources available in the region and produces methanol. Ismail explained how his company assisted an Indian steel producer switch to green hydrogen to decarbonize its production methods, resulting in a 10 to 20 percent cost reduction. He emphasized that at Xynteo, “we truly believe that industry has to be the driver for the energy transition.”\\n\\nBut there remain significant barriers to widespread hydrogen adoption. Joe Webster, Atlantic Council senior fellow, noted that there are a number of policy issues around hydrogen—especially around hourly matching, which would require hydrogen facilities to limit their use of electricity to an amount equivalent to the renewable energy they use in a given hour. Hussein Fouad El Ghazzawy, senior energy and industry consultant at LYNX, spoke from Egyptian and African perspectives. He cited that a recent European Investment Bank report showed that African clean-hydrogen production potential could reach fifty million tons per year by 2035. However, Africa remains tightly constrained by limited or insufficient infrastructure of all kinds. For global hydrogen economies of scale, further investments in Africa are needed, he said.\\n\\nThe panelists broadly agreed that the price of renewable energy is continuing to pose a challenge, as it plays a major role in high hydrogen costs. This is among the key areas where policymakers could potentially do more to support scaling of global hydrogen production.\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 5:30 AM WASHINGTON | 2:30 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nAchieving net-zero will require rethinking supply chains.

Fahad Alajlan, president of the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, noted how dramatically the conversation around fuels such as natural gas and nuclear has shifted since the war in Ukraine began. He argued that the world cannot deploy a whiplash approach to how it perceives energy and energy supply chains every time a new crisis emerges. Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman, president, and CEO of Baker Hughes, and Christian Bruch, president and CEO of Siemens Energy AG, supported Alajlan’s perspective. Simonelli reiterated that the key challenges are emissions—not a particular type of fuel—and thus there is no benefit for the public or private sector to be overwhelmed by arguments over certain energy sources. Herscowitz added that “[DFC] will finance gas projects… It’s one of the reasons I’m here, to see what we can do.”\\n\\nAnother key area of agreement was the need for energy efficiency throughout value chains, as well as thoughtful management of existing equipment. Bruch noted the risk of stranded assets—when a piece of energy infrastructure is not used for its full lifespan and thus becomes a financial loss—if the energy community fails to plan ahead and utilize what it has already.\\n\\nThe challenges to successfully transition supply chains to a net-zero world are thus substantial, but perhaps not insurmountable. Marisa Drew, chief sustainability officer at Standard Chartered Bank, described the need for unity and a frank discussion among all stakeholders on these very problems at the next United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP28, to unlock long-term, sustainable, and investable solutions.\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 5:30 AM WASHINGTON | 2:30 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nNuclear energy is ready for a breakout moment—if it can find the fuel\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nIs nuclear energy’s guiding mantra “no fuel, no fun”? Daniel Poneman, president and CEO of Centrus Energy Corp. and former deputy US secretary of energy, suggested as much in a special session of the Global Energy Forum on Sunday afternoon. He and expert panelists representing the Polish, Romanian, and Canadian nuclear energy industries delved into what opportunities and challenges lie ahead for nuclear power of all stripes in a decarbonizing world.\\n\\nThe panelists firmly agreed that, without nuclear power, achieving net-zero emissions is impossible for the global community; indeed, the world must grow its nuclear fleet and pursue innovative, emerging nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors and microreactors, which show tremendous potential as flexible reactor options. Ana Birchall, special envoy for strategic and international affairs at Nuclearelectrica, spoke from the Romanian perspective and emphasized the importance of nuclear now regaining its status as a clean, affordable, reliable fuel in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, she projected that Romania could, with its imminent unit additions, become an exporter of nuclear-generated zero-carbon power to its neighbors. Adam Guibourgé-Czetwertyński, undersecretary of state for the Polish Ministry of Climate and Environment, lauded nuclear energy in Poland as a source of energy independence and stable industrial supply.\\n\\nThat said, the panelists acknowledged that a buildout of nuclear power in a net-zero world faces some challenges. Most important, as Poneman explained, is the scarcity of supply (and suppliers) for High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel, which was produced in Russia but is now limited to just a few remaining suppliers. He recommended that the US government consider making a US-based plant a global supplier of HALEU, reducing the proliferation risks but enabling the necessary export of this crucial input.\\n\\nJoseph McBrearty, president and CEO of Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, delved into the permitting and stakeholder relationship challenges associated with nuclear energy construction and waste management. He noted that indigenous relationships are especially foundational to nuclear power companies—because nuclear facilities are often on or near indigenous-owned land—and that these and other relationships must be nurtured early on. Guibourgé-Czetwertyński and Birchall agreed that robust public support for nuclear energy is a lynchpin to a successful nuclear policy and noted that public support for nuclear energy is very high in both Poland and Romania thanks to their industries’ sterling safety records. Broadly, the panelists expressed optimism for advanced nuclear technologies to be a major component of the decarbonization puzzle and for the ability of industry to scale these technologies safely while maintaining public confidence.\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 5:00 AM WASHINGTON | 2:00 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nBiden administration official raises critical questions around critical minerals\\n\\nAmos Hochstein has a warning. The special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security at the US State Department said Sunday at the Global Energy Forum that securing minerals such as cobalt and copper, which are critical to clean energy technologies, is becoming a crucial challenge for the energy transition—and one that will look familiar to those who lived through the 1970s.\\n\\n“The way we’re going right now, we’re actually creating a carbon copy of the twentieth century geopolitics of energy architecture and just putting it in the twenty-first century,” Hochstein said. “Instead of having a small group of countries that control oil supply and perhaps refining, we’re now going to create one or maybe a couple of countries that will control the entire supply chain for wind, solar, electric vehicles, and chips.”\\n\\nThe geopolitics of energy in the 21st century could look a lot like the 20th century, warns @amoshochstein.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of a few countries controlling oil supply, we could now have one or a couple countries controlling supply chains for wind, solar, electric vehicles, and chips. pic.twitter.com/RM2rdHV6hd — Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) January 15, 2023\\n\\nRead the full transcript\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 2:30 AM WASHINGTON | 11:30 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nHow will the global climate effort change after the Inflation Reduction Act?\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): A zero-sum game, or transatlantic win-win? Brad Crabtree, assistant secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management at the US Department of Energy, says the latter. At a Global Energy Forum panel discussion, Crabtree argued that the IRA, despite concerns that some of its provisions may be nationalistic, is in many respects how the United States is paying it forward on achieving major global emissions reductions. “We, the United States as a country, have already benefited from the investments that others have made,” he said, later adding, “[t]he way we look at it, we’re all in this together.”\\n\\nBut he acknowledged some of the lingering concerns around the IRA, which has been criticized by European allies for subsidizing domestic industry at the expense of European companies, noting that officials “are working really hard now” on some of those concerns; he also said that the Biden administration will sincerely address these issues to the fullest extent possible. Other panelists argued that Europe should consider a similar approach to that of the United States. Lee Beck, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force noted that “climate is a political-economy outcome” and Europe could benefit greatly from an incentives-based approach that can commercialize technologies. Ben Backwell, chief executive officer of the Global Wind Energy Council, added, “It’s not about taking investment from one place and going somewhere else… we should not see this as a competitive thing at all.” He recommended designing “an IRA for Europe.”\\n\\nTim Holt, member of the executive board and labor director at Siemens Energy, and Julian Mylchreest, executive vice chairman of Global Corporate & Investment Banking for Bank of America, emphasized that there need not be a competition for money, attention, or other resources among the transatlantic allies. Both private-sector representatives agreed that there is sufficient capital for rapid decarbonization in the United States and the European Union. They argue the IRA is especially well-positioned to catalyze that money and drive transformational change at scale in key sectoral investments such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage.\\n\\nThe panelists all cautioned that more challenges to IRA implementation remain; Crabtree pointed out that the US government remains understaffed and under-resourced in managing the regulatory and permitting side of the IRA, particularly with the wave of applications for new infrastructure (such as carbon storage wells) that is expected to come. The panelists’ discussion conveyed that while the IRA represents a crucial and impactful step forward, realizing its full potential—for both the United States and the world at large—will be an ongoing process with numerous hurdles still ahead.\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 1:00 AM WASHINGTON | 10:00 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nOvercoming the biggest challenges that stand in the way of a net-zero developing world\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nAccording to Isabel Munilla, deputy assistant secretary of energy for market development, climate, and multilateral engagement at the US Department of Energy (DOE), “innovation anywhere supports progress everywhere.” Speaking at a Global Energy Forum panel about supporting developing countries in their net-zero goals, Munilla described a number of innovative programs at the DOE that may help, including the Net Zero World Initiative, which aims to mature, then scale, promising decarbonization technologies, as well as the Clean Energy Solutions Center, through which the Department offers technical assistance. She said that the DOE believes driving down costs for key technologies in the United States (such as with the DOE’s “cost targets for hydrogen and long-duration battery storage) will help set the developing world on a pathway to success.\\n\\nBut other panelists cited extant challenges. Otmane Benamar, GE Gas Power’s chief technology officer for Europe, Middle East, and Africa, warned that especially in the developing world, “a lot of grids cannot handle the intermittency of renewable fuel,” upping the urgency to improve and harden grid infrastructures. Daniel Schroth, director of the African Development Bank’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Department, agreed with Benamar, adding that focus should also be placed on improving legal and regulatory frameworks for power systems in developing countries. Mary Burce Warlick, deputy executive director at the International Energy Agency, pointed to the extremely high costs of capital—in some cases seven times that of developed regions—as a key limiting factor in moving money to the regions that need climate finance the most. She argued that governments providing concessional finance can help ignite the private sector, which can then begin to move money at a meaningful scale.\\n\\nThe panelists’ discussion conveyed that there are numerous and complex problems in scaling up climate development finance, and they are unlikely to be resolved with any silver-bullet solution; however, the panelists largely agreed that there is potential for transformative change.\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 12:15 AM WASHINGTON | 9:15 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nJohn Kerry on the carbon offset initiative that aims to bring renewable-energy investment to developing countries\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\n“We have to be more than deadly serious,” about climate change, said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry at the Global Energy Forum. “This is life and death.”\\n\\nKerry spoke on a panel that included representatives of each of the partners behind the Energy Transition Accelerator, a joint initiative introduced at COP27 last year that is intended to catalyze billions of dollars in much-needed private-sector investment to phase out fossil fuels and accelerate renewable energy.\\n\\nKerry said that the Accelerator is one important way to move trillions of dollars of annual climate financing (foundational to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius) to where it is needed most: developing countries and the energy sector. He explained that “energy is the single summary of how you cure this problem… [because] the problem is emissions.” The partners behind the Accelerator, he explained, are figuring out how to “de-risk the deals that are out there… and create valuable deals” that will make investment in the energy transition a viable opportunity for the global private sector.\\n\\nAt the Forum, the partners announced new guiding principles for the Accelerator, a list that calls the project to be inclusive, comprehensive, and high-integrity; it also calls on the project to promote near-term efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to incentivize new private-sector climate finance that is supplemental to, rather than a substitute for, other sources of finance.\\n\\nKerry was joined by Accelerator co-founders Andrew Steer, president and chief executive officer of the Bezos Earth Fund, and Elizabeth Yee, executive vice president of programs at The Rockefeller Foundation. Yee and Steer both emphasized the importance of a “highly credible” and transparent initiative, resilient to claims of “greenwashing.” Yee noted that the system created by the initiative must accelerate job growth in developing countries to build robust coalitions behind clean-energy acceleration. She also said that the Accelerator will need to ensure that it allocates a certain percentage of funds from carbon-credit sales toward adaptation purposes. Steer said that carbon credits are necessary because, without this clear incentive structure, cleaning up the global energy sector (through investment in renewable energy) is “not happening at anywhere near the pace that is required.” He added that the governance element of this mechanism, such as ensuring that emissions reductions in one locality are not neutralized by emissions increases elsewhere, is crucial to ensuring credibility and success.\\n\\nNobody is living by a law to hit 2050 net zero, said @ClimateEnvoy @JohnKerry today at @ACGlobalEnergy Forum.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s no law. People are doing it because they are exercising a sense of public responsibility,” he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more: ➡️ https://t.co/c1a8XrhORa#ACEnergyForum pic.twitter.com/NkeIDZbiMD — Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) January 15, 2023\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nJANUARY 15, 2023 | 12:00 AM WASHINGTON | 9:00 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nCOP28 leaders: Here’s how to spark a just energy transition that includes everyone\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nWhat does equity really mean in the context of the upcoming COP28? Panelists at the Global Energy Forum discussed how to ensure the entire global community is brought into the transition.\\n\\nYasmine Fouad, the Egyptian minister of environment and ministerial coordinator, played a key role in Egypt’s execution of COP27 in 2022 as the country’s climate envoy for the summit; she argued that each COP must build upon the other and that, going forward, COP28 must be defined not by exclusion but rather by inclusion. This inclusion should highlight groups such as the Global South, the world’s least developed countries, and women—but it should also embrace industries that have felt unwelcome in the COP process. Pointing to the oil and gas industry, Fouad said that “the crisis affects us all, so everyone has to be around the table.” She suggested that all industries and all sectors of the economy must be prepared to put forth credible transition strategies.\\n\\nMahmoud Mohieldin, the United Nations (UN) special envoy on financing 2030 agenda for sustainable development, focused on the need for localized solutions to ensure that no one gets left behind in the energy transition. He emphasized the financing challenge for debt-stressed developing economies and the progress made by innovative financing models at local, regional, and global levels that are directing money toward the most vulnerable countries and regions. He argued that because the climate crisis has arrived, “ministers from developing economies should ask for more funding for adaptation” immediately.\\n\\nDamilola Ogunbiyi, special representative of the UN secretary-general and chief executive officer of Sustainable Energy for All, concurred with Mohieldin on the need for immediate, innovative financing models. She cited her organization’s African Carbon Market Initiative as a key example but also encouraged further action: “You cannot hit net zero and leave a billion people in energy poverty,” she said. She added that close partnership with recipient countries, bearing their unique resources and potential decarbonization pathways in mind, must underpin these efforts, explaining that “being realistic about what a country has to do is important.”\\n\\nThe panelists’ remarks underscored the enormous challenge ahead for the UAE during its COP28 presidency as it seeks to integrate a wide range of sectors and stakeholders, particularly those long shut out from the COP processes; pave the way for an implementation plan for the loss and damage fund; and mobilize climate finance for the developing world.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nDay one coverage\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 7:30 AM ET WASHINGTON | 4:30 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nHow the UAE could tackle the tricky business of climate diplomacy\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nAs climate change rapidly accelerates, geopolitics seems to be pushing the key players who could resolve it further apart. But according to an expert panel of diplomatic and private-sector experts who gathered Saturday at the Global Energy Forum, that direction need not be destiny, and creative approaches may yet help the global community fill the gaps.\\n\\nCharles Hendry, former minister of state for energy for the United Kingdom, opened the discussion with the view that the United Arab Emirates, host of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) is ideally suited to help bridge the serious and growing differences among key stakeholders such as the United States and China, but also many developing countries skeptical of Western leadership on climate. Neil Brown, managing director at KKR Global Institute, concurred that the UAE brings “credibility” on climate negotiations where the United States and Europe often lack it. He emphasized the importance of what happens not at COP28 but afterwards—especially for the private sector. “Will [COP28] bring private capital off the sidelines?” Brown asked.\\n\\nPaula Dobriansky, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and vice chair of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, reiterated that great-power competition could still dangerously undermine collective, targeted action at COP28 regardless of who hosts the conference. She highlighted China and Russia as problematic examples of countries that remain largely aloof from the COP process and deeply suspicious of US leadership. Ana Palacio, former Spanish minister of foreign affairs and a member of the Atlantic Council’s board of directors, added that China is among those intent on undermining a rules-based international order. In this context, she argued that the US Inflation Reduction Act is a sorely needed example of leadership that has intrinsic value for Europe.\\n\\nThe panelists agreed that geopolitical competition is as tense now as anytime in recent memory—but this competition cannot be allowed to circumvent meaningful collaboration wherever possible on addressing climate issues. Trust and mutual agreement must be pursued wherever possible, and the UAE at COP28 may be best positioned to make up the trust deficit.\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 6:15 AM ET WASHINGTON | 3:15 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nThe role of natural gas vs. renewables sparks debate\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nAre expanded investments in natural gas fundamentally in conflict with renewable energy as the world ponders the reliability challenge of the coming decades? This was a central debate among panelists on Saturday at the Global Energy Forum.\\n\\nPaddy Padmanathan, vice-chairman and CEO of ACWA Power, which has a wide-ranging portfolio of projects in several developing countries, argued that the focus should be on the potential of renewable and emerging energies to power the future. He suggested that Europe can rapidly replace Russian energy resources with expanded renewable power and that it is already doing so. Likewise, many developing countries are starting from the ground floor on energy access altogether; renewable energy can be deployed quickly and effectively at scale, compared to conventional fuels projects which could take a decade or longer to become operational.\\n\\nBut the other panelists had different views. Helima Croft, managing director and head of global commodity strategy of RBC Capital Markets, cautioned that the worst of the global energy supply uncertainties may be yet to come—for example, if China reopens and dramatically increases its oil and gas demand later this year. She expressed concern that Europe and the world writ large may be forced to rely on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)—which has the only real spare capacity in the world—and traditional energy diplomacy in such a circumstance.\\n\\nOsama Mobarez, secretary general of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, emphasized that a strategy like REPowerEU, which may prove viable in Europe, may not be so in many developing countries. He warned that no one solution (such as renewable energy alone) can satisfy the energy needs of the world and that oil and gas will remain integral to the global energy system for years to come—themes echoed by speakers throughout the Forum. Carlos Pascual, senior vice president for global energy at S&P Global Commodity Insights, concurred that multiple energy sources are essential in a world where billions of people still lack access to reliable power and clean cooking resources. He added that high capital costs for many developing countries, which are not typically a barrier to renewable energies with high up-front costs in the United States and the European Union, are a major challenge that could potentially shut these economies out of major growth opportunities due to poor energy access.\\n\\nThis debate suggests that equity and justice considerations around clean energy, the Just Transition, and energy poverty remain fundamental challenges despite the rapid, and ongoing, progress in lowering barriers to zero-carbon energy sources.\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 5:15 AM ET WASHINGTON | 2:15 PM ABU DHABI\\n\\nEurope has taken major strides to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. How can it work for the long haul?\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nEurope has just faced one of the most dangerous, fraught years in its recent history—with energy security at the heart of the challenges presented by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the Global Energy Forum on Saturday, Ditte Juul Jørgensen, the European Commission’s director-general for energy, joined officials and business leaders to discuss how Europe weathered the storm (so far) and what the European Union (EU) can do in concert with its allies and private-sector leaders to remain resilient against Russia’s ongoing weaponization of energy.\\n\\nJørgensen’s keynote remarks highlighted how the EU’s energy security strategy, RePowerEU, was initially received with skepticism at its launch in May 2022—with critics asking: “Can Europe reduce its dependence on Russian energy supplies as much as they say they want to?” she recalled. “Yes is the answer after this year, and it has been done swifter than what anyone had in mind.”\\n\\nShe argued that by setting clear and binding targets, and matching action with ambition, Europe was able to withstand Russia’s attempts to starve the continent of energy. She concurred with Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukraine’s DTEK, who argued during the panel discussion that Ukraine can, and will, rebuild its energy infrastructure and become a reliable supplier of natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy to its European neighbors. “Putin will not plunge Ukraine into darkness,” he said. “The country will not be frozen. And we will be stronger after this winter season.”\\n\\nGeoffrey Pyatt, assistant US secretary of state for energy resources, said that the Russian invasion has demonstrated the strength and endurance of the US-EU alliance and that the United States remains firmly committed to seeing Europe through the upcoming winter and beyond. US liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and the shared commitment to energy transition, Pyatt said, are central to this partnership. He framed the Inflation Reduction Act, currently a source of transatlantic tension given its tax credits for electric vehicles made in the United States, as an opportunity for Europeans to invest in the United States and ultimately accelerate the energy transition on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nPanelists representing European energy companies offered their own suggestions on how Europe might move forward. Anatol Feygin, executive vice president and chief commercial officer of Cheniere Energy, suggested that his company has pioneered the very model of market flexibility that enabled Europe to resist Russia’s manipulation of energy markets. Even so, he argued that it is critical for suppliers of natural gas to continuously improve the lifecycle emissions profiles of their products. Luis Cabra, deputy CEO of Repsol, noted that while Europe has made vast strides in reducing emissions, renewables alone cannot solve the complex, multi-faceted problem of economy-wide transition.\\n\\nBen Wilson, chief strategy and external affairs officer of National Grid, suggested that the powerful combination of hydrogen and renewable energy is a compelling long-term solution for Europe and that investment in transmission must accompany the anticipated enormous expenditure in new renewable energy capacity. Amid these varying perspectives on what to do next, one thing is clear: Europe has a great deal of work ahead to fully disentangle itself from Russian energy over the long term.\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 2:00 AM ET WASHINGTON | 11:00 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nWhat will it take to solve the energy trilemma?\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nPanelists discussed the challenges in solving the energy trilemma—affordability, reliability, sustainability—at the Global Energy Forum on Saturday, soon after the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center launched the 2023 “Global Energy Agenda.” The panel featured Albanian minister of infrastructure and energy Belinda Balluku and experts representing private-sector energy companies including Crescent Petroleum, General Electric, and Excelerate Energy.\\n\\nBalluku opened the discussion with a frank assessment of the energy security situation in Southern Europe. She pointed out that there’s a need for not only a range of energy solutions to address the current crisis fueled by the Russian war in Ukraine, but also for long-term resiliency and economic growth in the region. She highlighted the importance of rapidly expanding Albania’s renewable energy resources (an expansion that has been accelerated all over Europe by Russia’s recent invasion). But she also noted the importance of Albania’s strategy around Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRU)—a strategy supported by the United States—which has since 2020 become a cornerstone project supplying imported liquid natural gas to Albania’s neighbors. Diversification of energy supplies and suppliers, she concluded, is thus crucial to Albania’s and Europe’s energy security. Steven Kobos, president and chief executive officer of Excelerate Energy, concurred with Balluku and pointed to his company’s rapid response FSRUs in Finland and elsewhere. He warned, however, that a real supply crisis for natural gas could be in the making as demand outside Europe could grow in the coming months and new supply in the near term will be sharply limited as new production infrastructure is still years out from operations.\\n\\nThe other panelists offered similarly nuanced views of the role of gas in the energy transition—particularly when considering the unique needs of many developing countries. Neeraj Agrawal, chief financial officer of Crescent Petroleum, described his company’s work harnessing natural gas to shift Iraqi electricity generation away from diesel fuel, which is more polluting. He argued that natural gas will be a lynchpin resource for many developing economies in Africa and Asia that are decarbonizing while providing a reliable power supply to more than one billion people worldwide who lack it. Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer at General Electric, agreed with the imperative to expand global electrification but steered the conversation toward the importance of resiliency. He argued that amid accelerating cyber attacks and intensifying climate change, the world must harden electrical grids. He also acknowledged the need to address the “ecosystem” of challenges in building energy infrastructure in many parts of the world which, he said, policy alone cannot solve on its own.\\n\\nRead the report\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 1:30 AM ET WASHINGTON | 10:30 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nPowering forward—and paying for—the energy transition\\n\\nThe energy transition will require unlocking tremendous amounts of capital; but energy investments aren’t keeping up as much as is needed, warned a panel of experts at the Global Energy Forum on Saturday.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nWatch\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 1:00 AM ET WASHINGTON | 10:00 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nUK official: Cooperation on a low-carbon, secure energy future “makes us all more prosperous”\\n\\nBy Andrea Clabough\\n\\nAccording to Grant Shapps—the UK secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy—energy matters more than it ever has before.\\n\\nShapps’s message was part of keynote remarks he delivered at the Global Energy Forum, where he emphasized both what has and has not changed in the energy sector over the last year. He pointed to hard energy-usage choices that the world has faced as prices for fuels have skyrocketed and the world’s low-income economies have been forced to make difficult decisions. In addition, the worrisome acceleration of climate change has presented a constant threat as heat waves have scorched Europe, bomb cyclones have devasted the United States, and flooding has led to thousands of fatalities in Pakistan.\\n\\nBut Shapps expressed his confidence in the future, arguing that “we will succeed as humanity” in fighting the existential challenge of climate change. He noted the growing number of entrepreneurs and innovators worldwide pushing ahead with crucial technological innovations, such as the recent nuclear fusion success at the United States’ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He lauded Britain’s rapid strides in building some of the largest wind farms in the world in the North Sea, which provide 86 percent of the United Kingdom’s electricity needs. These developments, he concluded, should give us all hope for the future.\\n\\nHe cautioned, however, that “a fairer future is worth fighting for” and emphasized the need for expanding just transition initiatives, such as those in South Africa and Indonesia, to provide both climate and economic security (as well as needed job growth) to developing countries. Despite the world facing what he deemed a challenge no other generation has faced before, he said there are many reasons to be hopeful—and much work to be done.\\n\\nShapps’s remarks took place a day after the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates signed a Clean Energy Memorandum of Understanding to increase investment and cooperation between the two countries on energy security. “When it comes to climate change… none of us should have to settle for less. So working together really matters.”\\n\\nJANUARY 14, 2023 | 12:45 AM ET WASHINGTON | 9:45 AM ABU DHABI\\n\\nGas is here to stay—until renewables are ready, say ministers\\n\\nAfter gas prices spiked this year, some energy users are beginning to regain a sense of equilibrium with steadier prices.

Russia’s gas cuts led Europe to compensate for the loss of energy supply by reverting to coal and oil, leading the global community to confront deepening tensions between national security, energy security, and climate action.\\n\\nHowever, the crisis in Europe, despite causing an upsurge in carbon-intensive power, provided the world with fresh impetus to change the trajectory of the energy transition. In response, policymakers worldwide are hastening efforts to decouple their economies from foreign hydrocarbons and to decarbonize energy systems. Ultimately, the war may accelerate longer-term energy trends toward a more sustainable and secure system.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, energy leaders head into 2023 with a greatly revised outlook from 2022, as revealed in the Atlantic Council’s third edition of the Global Energy Agenda. The publication includes an analysis based on our survey of energy stakeholders, representing a wide variety of professions across the sector from more than fifty countries. Complementing our survey analysis, a diverse group of experts, corporate leaders, and policymakers contributed essays that provide deeper insights on the tumult of 2022 and its implications for reshaping energy systems for the future.\\n\\nDespite a year defined by complications to the energy transition, there is reason to be optimistic as the global energy community doubles down on in-tandem efforts to achieve climate goals and longer-term energy security for all.\\n\\nRead the agenda\\n\\nFurther reading',\n",
       " 'ASTANA – Kazakhstan’s Vice Minister of Energy Zhandos Nurmaganbetov reiterated the country’s commitment to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060, as the Kazakh delegation took part in the 13th session of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Assembly in Abu Dhabi on Jan. 14-15, reported the ministry’s press service.\\n\\nOrganized by the IRENA, a leading global intergovernmental agency for energy transition, the event was attended by delegates from 168 countries and chaired by IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.\\n\\nIn a video address to the participants, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres said that renewable energy is the only credible path forward if the world is to avert a climate catastrophe, outlining a five-point plan for a just transition.\\n\\n“Only renewables can safeguard our future, close the energy access gap, stabilize prices and ensure energy security,” he said.\\n\\nThe world still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is fast slipping out of reach, Guterres warned.\\n\\n“Under current policies, we are headed for 2.8 degrees of global warming by the end of the century. The consequences will be devastating. Several parts of our planet will be uninhabitable. And for many, this is a death sentence,” he said.\\n\\nRenewable energy sources currently account for nearly 30 percent of global electricity. Guterres said this must double to over 60 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by mid-century.\\n\\nGuterres called for removing intellectual property barriers so that key renewable technologies, including energy storage, are treated as global public goods.\\n\\nThe UN Secretary-General said that countries also must diversify and increase access to supply chains for raw materials and components for renewable technologies without degrading the environment.\\n\\n“This can help create millions of green jobs, especially for women and youth in the developing world,” said Guterres.\\n\\nThe UN chief urged decision-makers to cut red tape, fast-track approvals for sustainable projects worldwide, and modernize power grids. He stressed the need to shift from fossil fuels to clean and affordable energy, adding that “we must support vulnerable groups affected by this transition.”\\n\\nAccording to Guterres, public and private investments in renewables should triple to at least $4 trillion a year.\\n\\nNoting that most investments in renewables are in developed countries, Guterres urged countries to work together to reduce the capital cost for renewables and ensure that financing flows to those who need it most.\\n\\nAddressing the meeting participants, Kazakhstan’s Vice Minister of Energy Zhandos Nurmaganbetov emphasized the country’s adherence to the sustainable development goals and its obligations under the Paris Agreement. According to him, Kazakhstan, alongside the international community, pays close attention to developing renewable energy sources.\\n\\nDuring their meeting with the IRENA top management, the Kazakh delegation explored the possibility of organizing a seminar on Central Asia in Kazakhstan, dedicated to the joint efforts of neighboring countries to accelerate the energy transition and use of the region’s vast renewable resources.',\n",
       " \"Powers recently attended COP27 in Egypt representing Schneider Electric as well as their large roster of corporate and industrial clients. Schneider is the leading global renewable energy, carbon, and sustainability advisor to large corporations, actively representing over 60TWh of global demand for renewable energy - equivalent to nearly half the electricity demand in all of Egypt.\\n\\nWhat were some of your key takeaways from COP27?\\n\\nI was really impressed. I think a lot of the feedback that you hear from any of the COPs is we're not doing enough and we're not doing it fast enough. And I agree. As a species, we're not doing enough, but that's been the case for two million years. So that's not a surprise or anything new. However, in the last 250 years since the Industrial Revolution, our population and consumerism have grown significantly and as a result, so has our reliance on the earth's resources. We simply cannot continue to grow without taking a critical and urgent look at how we are consuming these resources. And I do believe that summits like COP help to crystallize our efforts toward a more balanced relationship with the natural world.\\n\\nI think the progress made this year around reparations for some of the countries most heavily affected by climate change was important for environmental and social justice. I was also glad to see the commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5ºC be reaffirmed in the package of decisions between parties.\\n\\nHowever, my biggest takeaway was on the importance of public-private collaboration. I found myself repeatedly speaking with lawmakers and policymakers about the need for private sector allies when designing policy to reduce carbon. We all agree on the need to design policies that enable voluntary participants globally to go bigger and faster than even what the government pace is going to be. Our clients are happy there is a 2040 or 2050 carbon reduction or renewable energy goal in their country, but many want to get there by 2025 or 2030.\\n\\nHas COP changed your perspective on what Schneider could do?\\n\\nSchneider has public policy teams that interface with lawmakers and look for ways to collaborate, but I think there's even more that we could be doing collectively to drive public-private action on climate change. It's the public sector's job to unlock the ability for the private sector to accelerate new technologies, renewable adoptions, carbon reductions etc.\\n\\nSpeaking specifically from my focus and expertise in renewables, there are a lot of changes that, if implemented by policy makers, would benefit global renewable energy adoption by private companies:\\n\\nDeregulation allows corporations to choose where they get their power from, so they can more easily opt for renewable energy. Most of Europe and roughly half of the United States is deregulated. However, a big opportunity exists among many regulated countries, many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels, to have cleaner grids. If a company has a lot of activity in Asia Pacific markets, for instance, they won't have a choice of where their power is coming from. Opening that choice and allowing the private sector to participate would be huge.\\n\\nPolicy allowing for more decentralisation would enable organizations to build their own microgrid or power plant and sell power back to the grids. We find that the net-metering laws are widely varied across the globe and even within a single country. Governments encouraging electricity production close to load would have a myriad of benefits to the planet and the grid itself.\\n\\nThrough infrastructure support, the public sector could help unlock private renewables adoption. Our clients that are trying to reach 100 per cent renewable energy goals often struggle to get their long-term projects built simply because they are unable to get project permission, permits, or interconnection agreements fast enough. This is a big problem in Spain right now. The environmental permitting process is in some cases, delaying and even killing new renewable energy projects because the government is not able to issue permits fast enough.\\n\\nOur clients also experience issues with transmission grids. This is a problem we see frequently in the US, where the transmission grid and the process for interconnecting a new project to the grid in certain regions, is so convoluted and backlogged that it becomes nearly impossible to move projects forward.\\n\\nWithin sustainability, do you see the role of advisory changing going forward?\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. When I started in 2003, just getting anyone to pick up the phone and talk to you about sustainability or renewable energy was a real challenge. It was not on people's radar and not a primary focus.\\n\\n20 years later, sustainability and renewables are ubiquitous. Having a sustainability strategy and adopting renewable energy have become table stakes for any large global enterprise. When we started, we were working with the big tech companies who were some of the first to adopt sustainability and renewable energy initiatives. But now we're working with oil and gas companies, major chemical companies, manufacturers, steel and cement production, the supply chains of the pharmaceutical industry - everyone.\\n\\nWe are seeing a large increase in demand for sustainability and renewable energy solutions. We spent 18 of the last 20 years trying to grow the demand for corporations around the world to act on sustainability and renewable energy. Now sustainability ranks amongst the highest priorities on CEO agendas, and we are at the crest of this wave of corporate demand. Businesses must continue to act on this momentum to make sure the systems are in place to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.\\n\\nThe increasingly global attendance of COP27 reflects this, with representation from over 200 countries this year. We've got more corporate renewable energy and sustainability demand in East Asia, Japan, China, and Asia Pacific generally. It's now the availability of increasingly impactful solutions that are lagging rather than demand. We're seeing markets open up, but with the right regulation this can happen faster; private sector demand is no longer the barrier to progress. Our role as consultants has evolved from convincing businesses that sustainability is the right thing to do, to now collaborating with our most ambitious clients and public sector partners to forge new paths for action.\\n\\nIt's an exciting time for anyone in the sustainability space. The stakes are higher than ever, and the opportunities to act are not only abundant, but also growing.

       " 'About 800,000 years after humans first used and controlled fire, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Berkeley, Calif., ignited a new kind of fire for the first time. On December 5, a nuclear fusion reaction successfully produced more power than it took to start. Then, it flickered out. A potentially limitless source of carbon-free energy appeared on the horizon but the road to fusion power on the electric grid will take time.\\n\\nThe fusion process, unlike the fission reactors currently used in the energy industry, produces no radioactive waste, making it potentially the cleanest source of energy in history. Fusion reactors also present no risk of meltdowns that, though rare, are a major concern with fission reactors. Oxford, U.K.-based Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society estimates that fusion energy could cost half what electricity generated by onshore wind facilities does. In our conversations with fusion startup executives, they describe vast generators requiring billions in capital investments as well as small-footprint facilities that would fit in a city block and cost only a half-billion dollars to build. Both approaches could augment the emerging distributed grid.\\n\\nScience has worked for almost 70 years to achieve fusion ignition. By contrast, pre- and early-human use of fire took about 400,000 to become commonplace in the archeological record. To use fire as a tool, humans first had to wait for a fire to occur naturally and master transporting embers, then learn to make their own fires using flint and iron or pyrite, as well as avoid suffocating in closed caves and prevent fire from spreading beyond the hearth. We think of these as simple lessons but they took hundreds of thousands of years to propagate across our species.\\n\\nIn these accelerated, connected times, fusion’s slow progress since the 1950s represents immense progress; we may be more than halfway to realizing the dream. Academic researchers believe fusion will be commercially viable in the second half of the century, at the earliest.\\n\\nWhat Happened on December 5?\\n\\nLike early humans working with flint in the cold and wind to ignite tinder, fusion scientists have been trying to spark a reaction that lasts more than milliseconds. In short, they want to get more energy out of the ignited reaction than they put in before the fire goes out. Fusion reactions are ignited by lasers pointed at a small fuel pellet in the reactor, which produces energy by forcing elements to combine into another element. In the NIF’s case, two hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium are fused, releasing a helium atom, a free neutron, and a lot of excess energy, which could be used to heat water to generate electricity.\\n\\n“I don’t want to give you a sense that we’re going to plug the NIF into the grid: That is definitely not how this works,” said Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Director Kim Budil at a press conference on December 13. “Ignition is a first step — a truly monumental one that sets the stage for a transformational decade in high energy density science and fusion research — and I cannot wait to see where it takes us.”\\n\\nThe NIF team’s December experiment used 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to generate 3.15 MJ in output, or about 54% more energy than the 2.05 MJ that generated the reaction. The catch here is that powering up the banks of lasers and the loss of energy as it was transferred to the lasers required required 322 MJ of energy — 1oo times the fusion energy generated. Nevertheless, when measured on a direct input-output basis, December 5 represents a significant breakthrough, and future experiments will focus on reducing the energy needed to power the lasers.\\n\\nFusion produces a plasma, a soup of charged particles as hot as the core of the sun. Next, science must master keeping the fire lit and containing and using the heat generated by the fusion reaction.\\n\\nWhat Happens Next?\\n\\nThe NIF’s mission is to simulate the energy created by a nuclear explosion, not to develop electricity-generating fusion reactors. The Department of Energy announced a 10-year plan to develop commercial fusion energy last March. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the agency will accelerate fusion innovation by combining government research under one umbrella program, though the NIF may remain focused on weapons projects. With more than 30 private companies pursuing fusion power generation, the main action may take place outside of government and academic laboratories.\\n\\nFusion-powered electricity generation, which involves managing temperatures of as much as 150 million degrees, must solve a variety of problems to become commercially viable.\\n\\nKeeping the Reaction Going\\n\\nEarly fusion reactors may need to be reignited frequently. Finding efficient ways to inject additional tiny pellets of deuterium and tritium, the fuel for the fusion reaction, into the reactor quickly will be key to maximizing power generation and minimizing downtime. Eventually, self-sustaining fusion, when the heat keeps the reaction going, will keep the reactor working for long periods. Extended reactions are key to generating enough electricity to maintain the baseload power levels necessary to support homes and businesses on the grid all day long.\\n\\nSolving Plasma Containment\\n\\nFusion plasmas are controlled and held in place using magnetic fields. When the containment field fails or is breached, the reaction stops instantaneously, so efficient management of plasma and the containment system is key to generating energy efficiently. Several reactor configurations and different fuels are under development, and more than one combination may be successful. The most popular approach is a donut-like ring reactor like the NIF’s, known as a tokomak. Linear systems that drive energy into a central chamber where the plasma is contained from each end represent a second strategy, one led by TAE Energy, which has raised more than $800 million in funding to date.\\n\\nGetting the Energy Out of the Reaction and Into an Electric Generator\\n\\nOnce the reaction is persistent and the plasma is manageable, the problem of getting the heat from the reactor to a generation system will be key to generating the most electricity possible. Heating water by bringing it into contact with the plasma through pipes and using a molten material — such as salt to transfer heat from the reaction chamber to a generator — are two options; others may emerge.\\n\\nBut here we run into the problem of radiation contamination in the environment immediately around the reactor.\\n\\nPreventing Neutron-Caused Damage\\n\\nRemember that in addition to the energy generated, a free neutron is produced. Neutrons, which accelerate ionization, making metals brittle increasing the likelihood of failure and potentially high maintenance costs. Parts of the reactor may need to be replaced frequently to prevent failures because the components have become brittle.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the fusion reaction itself doesn’t produce radioactive waste, current fusion technologies, which allow some of the neutrons produced in the reaction to escape, can make the structure of the reactor equipment and building radioactive. This problem must be overcome before the technology can become ubiquitous.\\n\\nMaking the “Fuel”\\n\\nTritium, the hydrogen isotope used in the NIF reaction, doesn’t occur naturally in large concentrations. It must be bred in a fusion reactor, where neutrons can convert lithium into helium and tritium. And that’s expensive. Other fusion reaction fuels, such a boron, which TAE Energy uses, are available in large volumes in nature. In all cases, new processes and environmentally responsible methods of manufacturing need to be evolved to support long-term generation of electricity.\\n\\nWhen Will Fusion Arrive?\\n\\nDespite optimistic claims by fusion startups that they will be providing commercial energy by 2035, fusion is likely to take longer to reach that goal. In fact, the largest fusion reactor project aiming to generate electricity in the world, the $22 billion ITER project being built in St-Paul-lès-Durance, France, is not expected to achieve ignition until 2035. However, the pace of investment — by government and private parties — is accelerating. The Biden Administration has made fusion an anchor technology in its decarbonization plan and touts the idea that fusion could play a meaningful role in U.S. and global carbon-free electricity production in the late 2030s.\\n\\nIt is safe to say, because of the state of research and the time involved in building generation plants, that fusion will not be part of the energy infrastructure until the 2040s at the earliest. However, history shows that the unexpected often happens, and scientists may crack the problem sooner. In the meantime, homes and business need to continue to use electricity more efficiently so that the available supply can support new demand for power, which is expected to double by 2050.',\n",
       " 'In an effort to help its customers become more sustainable and keep their costs as low as possible, UK national operator BT has unveiled new digital tools for its business users that, the telco claims, can track the energy consumption and carbon footprint of enterprise networks.\\n\\nThe new software tools are aimed at multinational customers and are designed to measure and optimise the environmental impact of running applications and cloud workloads across their networks.\\n\\nOne of the tools, dubbed the Carbon Network Dashboard, promises to provide a “real-time view of power consumption”, using machine learning (ML) to determine and predict anomalies based on historic usage. It is also able to identify which network devices consume the most power, as well as forecast total energy use based on network inventory and historic utilisation, BT noted in its press release.\\n\\nThe dashboard also shows how electricity usage translates into carbon emissions with the help of carbon intensity data from regional power grids, which measures the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of electricity produced. The tool is also set to draw on broader real-time information sources, such as renewable energy on national grids and in datacentres.\\n\\nBT’s other device is the Digital Carbon Calculator, which can estimate the carbon footprint of a business’s network. This is done by scanning the customer’s network inventory and tracking how it responds to changes and upgrades over time. Lifecycle management is also included, as the calculator identifies devices that have reached the end of their service and need to be replaced. Customers can also upload an inventory of their network equipment for analysis.\\n\\nThe announcement of these tools for BT’s UK enterprise customers is part of the company’s pledge to help save some 60 million tonnes of carbon emissions by the end of the decade. The move also aims to help companies with the significant challenge of measuring Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from a company’s supply chain), which represent more than 95% of total emissions, according to estimations made by Gartner. While the tools are not yet available and BT is yet to announce a specific timeline for their launch, it has confirmed that the Digital Carbon Calculator is of higher priority.\\n\\n“With customers hosting more of their applications across multiple clouds, networks are now increasingly vital for all elements of business performance, including carbon impact. Our new tools empower customers to reduce their Scope 3 emissions by optimising their network or scheduling digital workloads when renewable energy is available, helping them to achieve their net zero goals,” noted Sarwar Khan, head of digital sustainability at BT’s Global unit, which is being merged with BT Enterprise to form a new division called BT Business.\\n\\nA spokesperson for BT told TelecomTV that the Carbon Network Dashboard has been developed in-house on top of a third-party platform called IBM SevOne, which is used to provide performance management to BT’s existing managed service customers. The Digital Carbon Calculator has also been developed by BT’s team, with data feeds for the carbon emissions of the networking equipment being supplied by the vendors and feeding into the tool.\\n\\n“The tools cover networking devices ranging from LAN [local area network] switches, datacentre switches, routers, access points and unified communication end points. In the future, we also plan to include servers,” commented Kahn in a statement for TelecomTV. The database currently used by BT includes vendor information for equipment supplied by Cisco, Palo Alto, Meraki and Aruba.\\n\\n“We’ve exposed Cisco datapoints to begin with as this covers a large proportion of customer networking equipment. We’ll be exposing the other vendor information in the coming months. We’ll also be looking to include vendor data for Fortinet and F5 alongside Dell,” added Kahn.\\n\\nInterested in this topic? Then register for The Green Network Summit (25 - 26 January) and hear what executives from American Tower, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telenor, Telefónica, Vodafone and many other leading telecom companies have to say about energy-efficiency targets, sustainable supply chains, how best to monitor network power consumption, and much more.\\n\\nThe need for monitoring the sustainability of operations has repeatedly cropped up, as companies and organisations the world over strive for a net-zero future and deal with eye-watering energy costs.\\n\\nAt MWC22, the NGMN Alliance unveiled plans to develop a “ground-breaking” green network measurement methodology – see NGMN Alliance brings its green network benchmark plan to #MWC22.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the CMO of Rakuten Symphony, Geoff Hollingworth, is encouraging an alternative approach that he refers to as “pragmatic sustainability” – see Rakuten Symphony pitches a pragmatic approach to telco sustainability.\\n\\n- Yanitsa Boyadzhieva, Deputy Editor, TelecomTV',\n",
       " 'Answers to big problems aren’t always complex and difficult to identify. Sometimes they’re relatively simple and right in front of us. This, we believe, is true about the energy crisis that has faced America and the world.\\n\\nThe solution is here.\\n\\nAmerican natural gas and oil can significantly address global supply issues that surfaced after the pandemic and were inflamed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These have impacted nations, economies, businesses and families. Over the past many months, the world has learned that more natural gas and oil production, not less, is needed -- now and in the future.\\n\\nAmerican energy leadership has never been more critical. Fortunately, the solution is right beneath our feet.\\n\\nAPI’s annual State of American Energy event and annual report highlight the policies that can go far in solving our energy challenges at present and for decades to come. With the right set of actions on energy, America can launch a new era of energy leadership with robust natural gas and oil production here at home.\\n\\nWhat America should do is plain, though not necessarily easy. The past two years have seen too much confusion and misdirection on energy from Washington, which has tried to drive a version of an “energy transition” -- with aspirational policies dictating market and consumer outcomes -- that is unrealistic and potentially harmful for society. We only need to look to Europe to see what can happen when energy policy isn’t based on reliable, affordable, adaptable energy sources.\\n\\nWashington needs a course correction, and API is offering policy solutions to ensure American energy security, economic growth and continued progress toward a lower-carbon future. Think of our plan in three buckets: Make, Move and Improve.\\n\\nMake\\n\\nWe must make more American energy. Washington can help by lifting developmental restrictions on federal lands and waters, which provide a quarter of total U.S. oil and natural gas production. This could add 395 million barrels of oil equivalent of production through 2035. Increased access to natural gas and oil in federal areas -- offshore and onshore -- is critical for U.S. energy security now and in the long run.\\n\\nFailing to implement policies that clearly support new natural gas and oil investment and production to keep pace with projected growing demand could risk returning America to the days of ever-increasing foreign imports. And steadily increasing dependency. We left that behind with the U.S. shale revolution, and we should not go back. The American people agree: Nine in 10 voters support America developing its own energy rather than relying on foreign powers.\\n\\nIn addition, let’s maintain and strengthen what we have -- a refining sector that’s second to none, providing the fuels and petroleum-based chemical components for the products Americans need every day. We must not weaken our refineries by forcing them to abandon safe, proven processes used to make these products, as EPA has discussed.\\n\\nMost importantly, Washington must signal a new commitment to American natural gas and oil -- a recognition that they are integral to America’s energy security and will be for the foreseeable future. Negative rhetoric from the administration, leveled at American energy producers and undermining the capabilities of the world’s leading natural gas and oil producer, must end -- replaced with a spirit of genuine partnership to capitalize on America’s energy abundance.\\n\\nMove\\n\\nAmerica needs more natural gas and oil infrastructure -- pipelines, refineries and other facilities -- to move energy and meet projected growing demand. Unfortunately, red tape and protracted processes kill too many projects before they can be born.\\n\\nA recent analysis counted 10 major natural gas and oil infrastructure projects that were canceled or at risk of cancellation because of prolonged, uncertain federal review processes. They reflect tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures and jobs that could benefit local and regional economies.\\n\\nInfrastructure setbacks restrict movement of natural gas and oil from production zones to fuel centers and then to consumers -- and can be tantamount to energy denied to underserved regions of the country, such as New England.\\n\\nAdditionally, America must continue building its ability to export natural gas and oil to our allies. U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas helped stave off catastrophe in Europe last year and are a big part of America’s global leadership muscle, creating diverse supply opportunities for countries around the world. While exports help America’s friends, they are helping spur new production, jobs and economic benefits in America.\\n\\nSo, let’s continue to have thoughtful and thorough project planning, oversight and review, but let’s do it in ways that include clear timelines for investors and builders. Streamlined processes with time limits will help keep projects from falling into a kind of limbo that hinders new and needed infrastructure.\\n\\nImprove\\n\\nThe challenge before all of us -- energy producers, government, citizens -- is meeting the dual challenge of satisfying demand for reliable, affordable energy while also continuing to reduce emissions and protect the environment.\\n\\nThe United Nations projects that world population will grow more than 20% between now and 2050. Energy demand will grow with it, and the complexity is solving for energy demand and emissions reductions at the same time.\\n\\nWe’re already on it. API’s Climate Action Framework is an energy blueprint to help usher in a lower carbon future. Initiatives including The Environmental Partnership have helped improve technologies and procedures to reduce emissions, while API Energy Excellence focuses on accelerating safety and operational integrity across the industry. Through technologies and innovation -- and our industry’s DNA as a problem-solver -- we are committed to continued progress.\\n\\nPolicy can help. For example, efficient implementation of the Section 45Q tax credit can help spur $77 billion in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) investment between now and 2035 while increasing CCUS capacity by 250 million tons per annum. We also can improve the Section 45V tax credit to help advance clean hydrogen production. We should have a permitting architecture for low-carbon infrastructure, including pipelines associated with CCUS, that is consistent, timely and predictable to encourage new investment.\\n\\nAt this defining moment in history, America needs to lead on energy by safely developing its own natural gas and oil resources. Asking other countries to produce more is an abdication of America’s unique ability to lead. We need bipartisan policymaking that recognizes energy realities. Chief among them is the leading role natural gas and oil are projected to play for decades to come as other energy sources grow and spread.\\n\\nThe good news is America has the natural gas and oil to be more energy secure, to power our economy and Americans’ daily lives, and to keep us on the path to a lower carbon future. The challenges are big, but so are the opportunities. The future is ours to shape, but only if we work together. We invite members of Congress, the administration and leaders across the country to join us in rolling up our sleeves to unleash American natural gas and oil.\\n\\nIt starts with this simple realization: The solution is here.\\n\\nMike Sommers is President and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute (API).',\n",

Again, that’s part of that focus to deliver affordable, reliable clean energy to our customers,” said Cullen. “We also expect the steps we are taking, adding that renewable energy generation as well as retiring older, less efficient fossil fuel facilities will provide approximately $2 billion worth of savings to our customers over the next 20 years.”\\n\\nWPS’s net carbon neutral goal matches the one Governor Tony Evers set for the state of all electricity consumed within Wisconsin to be 100% carbon-free by 2050.',\n",
       " 'As interest in green hydrogen picks up worldwide, energy firms are using a variety of renewable energy projects to power hydrogen production. One major source for this production is wind power, thanks to decades of development of wind farms worldwide. Green hydrogen has been hailed by many as a magical fuel that could eventually provide an alternative to diesel and jet fuel, as well as a movement away from the sole reliance on electric batteries – produced using mined metals and minerals. However, the reason for the sudden interest in green hydrogen by many energy companies is to support longer-term oil and gas production by helping to decarbonize operations.\\n\\nThe U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy believes that the net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 target cannot be achieved by relying purely on renewable electricity. Instead, green hydrogen could provide households with a vital heating source and could contribute substantially to the decarbonization of the transport sector. It could also be used in industries that currently rely heavily on fossil fuels, and in agriculture. While the production of blue and grey hydrogen – using natural gas to drive output – is already fairly common, the production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources is less typical.\\n\\nThe growing number of wind farms in the U.S. and other countries around the world could help energy companies to shift their hydrogen production practices from blue and grey to green. Green hydrogen is produced using renewable electricity to power an electrolyzer, which then splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is then burned to produce power, emitting only water vapor and warm air, making it carbon-free. The potential for green hydrogen produced from wind energy is significant, as both onshore and offshore wind operations are expanding at a rapid rate.\\n\\nIn the U.S., the offshore wind pipeline grew by 13.5 percent in 2021, compared to 2020, with 40,083 megawatts (MW) now in various stages of development. In 2021 and 2022, the government expanded the areas of the U.S. available for offshore wind development, auctioning several new lease areas. This development was supported by the falling costs of wind energy projects, with the cost of commercial-scale offshore wind projects decreasing by 13 percent, to $84/MW-hour on average. Meanwhile, global offshore wind installations saw a record year in 2021, with the commissioning of 17,398 MW of new projects, meaning a global installed capacity of over 50 GW.\\n\\nThe development of the green hydrogen industry is seen as key to a green transition as it has the potential to replace natural gas in heating, as well as to be used in place of diesel and other fuels. In Europe and Asia, numerous large-scale green hydrogen projects have been announced over the last year, with a major hydrogen corridor planned for Europe. At present, the production of green hydrogen is expensive compared to other forms of renewable energy. However, much like solar and wind power, production prices are expected to drop significantly as hydrogen operations expand worldwide.\\n\\nBut many energy companies are looking to green hydrogen not only to support the transition away from fossil fuels but to decarbonize oil and gas operations to boost their longevity. In the Gulf of Mexico, offshore wind farms have attracted great interest, with some looking to use the energy to power homes in Texas and Louisiana – around 3.1 million houses in total – and others seeing the potential for powering oil refining operations. The Biden administration plans to build 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, capable of powering 10 million homes. But others are eyeing the windfarms for their potential to fuel green hydrogen projects that could power industrial processes, helping energy firms to decarbonize operations.\\n\\nGreen hydrogen would be sent to shore via oil and gas pipelines, replacing fossil fuels in powering oil operations, reducing carbon emissions by as much as 68 percent. This would be the first project of its kind and could spur other companies around the globe to do the same. Some opponents believe it would be prolonging the lifespan of the fossil fuel projects that they wish to end. The national policy director for Taproot Earth, Kendall Dix, explained: “Hydrogen is, at worst, a false solution and, at best, potentially a distraction.”\\n\\nMany oil and gas majors have already started to shift to lower-carbon oil operations by moving away from aging oil regions to new areas, such as Africa and the Caribbean, and incorporating carbon-cutting technologies. Wind-powered hydrogen production is just the latest trend that Big Oil is jumping on as a means of extending the potential lifespan of oil and gas operations, to meet the high global demand while decarbonizing. But many believe this is a fallacy and that as demand for green hydrogen increases, the clean fuel source could be better used for heating and transportation in a bigger transition away from fossil fuels.\\n\\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\\n\\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\\n\\nRead this article on OilPrice.com',\n",

       " 'Xbox is working to reduce our environmental impact to help us reach Microsoft’s goal of being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030 by rethinking how we design, build, distribute, and use our products.\\n\\nLast March, we shared an update on our sustainability efforts across hardware, software, waste reduction, and collective action. We are constantly looking at the ways in which we can innovate, learn, and improve upon our measures, as well as continue collaborating with industry partners and game developers. We not only hold ourselves accountable to the carbon emissions in the production and distribution of our products, but to the emissions created with the use of our products in the homes of our fans as well. So, the way we design our hardware and software to be more efficient and optimized for renewable energy can have a big impact.\\n\\nToday we are sharing updates that are rolling out to Xbox Insiders. The upcoming changes will create opportunities for our collective community of gamers to make choices to reduce environmental impact while gaming.\\n\\nXbox is now the first gaming console to offer carbon aware game downloads and updates\\n\\nBeing carbon aware means reducing carbon footprint by optimizing updates and downloads to run at a time when the console can use the most renewable energy. Windows Update became carbon aware last year for Windows 11 PCs, and now Xbox consoles are also becoming carbon aware.\\n\\nWhen your console is plugged in, connected to the Internet and regional carbon intensity data is available, Xbox will schedule game, app, and OS updates for your console at specific times during the nightly maintenance window that may result in lower carbon emissions because a higher proportion of electricity is coming from lower-carbon sources on the electric grid. For example, instead of your Xbox waking up during the nightly maintenance window at a random time between 2:00 AM – 6:00 AM, your console will wake up at a time when it can use the most renewable energy in your local energy grid. This decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions, and could potentially save you money. While only available to Xbox Insiders that use Shutdown (energy saving) right now, all Xbox gamers will have the chance to update soon so that your Xbox console is carbon aware.\\n\\nEnergy settings that help your Xbox save energy\\n\\nStarting today, Xbox Insiders will notice that their Xbox Series X|S consoles automatically update to the Shutdown (energy saving) power option. This one-time update to your power settings will reduce your power consumption while your console is off, and will not affect performance, gameplay, or your console’s ability to receive overnight updates to system, games or apps. Remote features are supported while the console is powered-on; however, remote wake is not supported while the console is shut down. You can adjust your settings at any time, choosing what works best for you. Shutdown (energy saving) cuts power use by up to 20X when it’s off compared to Sleep.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore options for all players to reduce their environmental impact, Xbox One consoles will begin to see new power mode options, including shutdown (energy saving) as early as today. Xbox One consoles will be testing multiple messaging options to determine the best way to inform players of the change. This effort is to provide Xbox One gamers an opportunity to provide feedback on their experience.\\n\\nShutdown (energy saving) will allow Xbox One consoles to receive system, game or app downloads overnight, just like Xbox Series X|S. With Shutdown (energy saving) selected, Xbox One consoles will experience a slower boot time. Remote features are still supported while the console is powered on.\\n\\nWe encourage all players to learn more about the power setting options available to you. Every small step we take has larger collective impact – and choosing shutdown (energy saving) can have real, meaningful impact. For example, for every 2 consoles that switch to Shutdown (energy saving) for one year, we will save the equivalent amount of carbon removed by 1 tree planted and grown for a decade. This is based on an average of Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles on Shutdown (energy saving) for 20 hours per day for 1 year; actual energy savings and avoided emissions may vary by console and other factors. Using Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator | US EPA.\\n\\nImproved sustainability with “Active hours” and Sleep\\n\\nAnother energy setting update that will start to roll out to Xbox Insiders today is the new “Active hours” setting. For those that select the Sleep power option, you can now adjust your console’s active hours. Your Xbox will boot quickly and will be available for remote wake during your selected active hours. When your Xbox’s active hours are done for the day, it will fully shut down and will draw 0.5 W vs. 10-15 W while active.\\n\\nXbox Series X|S active hours will be automatically enabled and scheduled based on times when the console was previously used\\n\\nXbox One consoles will have the option to configure their active hours, which will default to “always active” unless changed\\n\\nHow you can help\\n\\nWe can’t do this alone. We must work together with our players, developers, studios, and the industry if we’re going to help reduce gaming’s impact on the environment. We’re committed to collaborating with our developers, partnering with organizations, and empowering players to make more informed decisions.\\n\\nHere are some specific ways you can help:\\n\\nChoose the settings that help you and your Xbox save energy\\n\\nChoose shutdown (energy saving) as a power option on your Xbox. If you are not part of Xbox Insiders and want to adjust your settings to get the best energy saving option prior to the automatic update go to Settings > General > Power options. It will help conserve power and enable carbon aware updates on your Xbox.\\n\\nChoose shutdown (energy saving) as a power option on your Xbox.

       " 'In the future, the energy needed to run the powerful computers on board a global fleet of autonomous vehicles could generate as many greenhouse gas emissions as all the data centers in the world today.\\n\\nThat is one key finding of a new study from MIT researchers that explored the potential energy consumption and related carbon emissions if autonomous vehicles are widely adopted.\\n\\nThe data centers that house the physical computing infrastructure used for running applications are widely known for their large carbon footprint: They currently account for about 0.3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, or about as much carbon as the country of Argentina produces annually, according to the International Energy Agency. Realizing that less attention has been paid to the potential footprint of autonomous vehicles, the MIT researchers built a statistical model to study the problem. They determined that 1 billion autonomous vehicles, each driving for one hour per day with a computer consuming 840 watts, would consume enough energy to generate about the same amount of emissions as data centers currently do.\\n\\nThe researchers also found that in over 90 percent of modeled scenarios, to keep autonomous vehicle emissions from zooming past current data center emissions, each vehicle must use less than 1.2 kilowatts of power for computing, which would require more efficient hardware. In one scenario — where 95 percent of the global fleet of vehicles is autonomous in 2050, computational workloads double every three years, and the world continues to decarbonize at the current rate — they found that hardware efficiency would need to double faster than every 1.1 years to keep emissions under those levels.\\n\\n“If we just keep the business-as-usual trends in decarbonization and the current rate of hardware efficiency improvements, it doesn’t seem like it is going to be enough to constrain the emissions from computing onboard autonomous vehicles. This has the potential to become an enormous problem. But if we get ahead of it, we could design more efficient autonomous vehicles that have a smaller carbon footprint from the start,” says first author Soumya Sudhakar, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics.\\n\\nSudhakar wrote the paper with her co-advisors Vivienne Sze, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE); and Sertac Karaman, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics and director of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research appears today in the January-February issue of IEEE Micro.\\n\\nModeling emissions\\n\\nThe researchers built a framework to explore the operational emissions from computers on board a global fleet of electric vehicles that are fully autonomous, meaning they don’t require a back-up human driver.\\n\\nThe model is a function of the number of vehicles in the global fleet, the power of each computer on each vehicle, the hours driven by each vehicle, and the carbon intensity of the electricity powering each computer.\\n\\n“On its own, that looks like a deceptively simple equation. But each of those variables contains a lot of uncertainty because we are considering an emerging application that is not here yet,” Sudhakar says.\\n\\nFor instance, some research suggests that the amount of time driven in autonomous vehicles might increase because people can multitask while driving and the young and the elderly could drive more. But other research suggests that time spent driving might decrease because algorithms could find optimal routes that get people to their destinations faster.\\n\\nIn addition to considering these uncertainties, the researchers also needed to model advanced computing hardware and software that doesn’t exist yet.\\n\\nTo accomplish that, they modeled the workload of a popular algorithm for autonomous vehicles, known as a multitask deep neural network because it can perform many tasks at once. They explored how much energy this deep neural network would consume if it were processing many high-resolution inputs from many cameras with high frame rates, simultaneously.\\n\\nWhen they used the probabilistic model to explore different scenarios, Sudhakar was surprised by how quickly the algorithms’ workload added up.\\n\\nFor example, if an autonomous vehicle has 10 deep neural networks processing images from 10 cameras, and that vehicle drives for one hour a day, it will make 21.6 million inferences each day. One billion vehicles would make 21.6 quadrillion inferences. To put that into perspective, all of Facebook’s data centers worldwide make a few trillion inferences each day (1 quadrillion is 1,000 trillion).\\n\\n“After seeing the results, this makes a lot of sense, but it is not something that is on a lot of people’s radar. These vehicles could actually be using a ton of computer power. They have a 360-degree view of the world, so while we have two eyes, they may have 20 eyes, looking all over the place and trying to understand all the things that are happening at the same time,” Karaman says.\\n\\nAutonomous vehicles would be used for moving goods, as well as people, so there could be a massive amount of computing power distributed along global supply chains, he says. And their model only considers computing — it doesn’t take into account the energy consumed by vehicle sensors or the emissions generated during manufacturing.\\n\\nKeeping emissions in check\\n\\nTo keep emissions from spiraling out of control, the researchers found that each autonomous vehicle needs to consume less than 1.2 kilowatts of energy for computing. For that to be possible, computing hardware must become more efficient at a significantly faster pace, doubling in efficiency about every 1.1 years.\\n\\nOne way to boost that efficiency could be to use more specialized hardware, which is designed to run specific driving algorithms. Because researchers know the navigation and perception tasks required for autonomous driving, it could be easier to design specialized hardware for those tasks, Sudhakar says. But vehicles tend to have 10- or 20-year lifespans, so one challenge in developing specialized hardware would be to “future-proof” it so it can run new algorithms.\\n\\nIn the future, researchers could also make the algorithms more efficient, so they would need less computing power. However, this is also challenging because trading off some accuracy for more efficiency could hamper vehicle safety.\\n\\nNow that they have demonstrated this framework, the researchers want to continue exploring hardware efficiency and algorithm improvements. In addition, they say their model can be enhanced by characterizing embodied carbon from autonomous vehicles — the carbon emissions generated when a car is manufactured — and emissions from a vehicle’s sensors.\\n\\nWhile there are still many scenarios to explore, the researchers hope that this work sheds light on a potential problem people may not have considered.\\n\\n“We are hoping that people will think of emissions and carbon efficiency as important metrics to consider in their designs. The energy consumption of an autonomous vehicle is really critical, not just for extending the battery life, but also for sustainability,” says Sze.\\n\\nThis research was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation and the MIT-Accenture Fellowship.',\n",

       " 'Energy has frequently been at the top of the news agenda over the past year, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fossil-fuel prices – and, thus, the cost of living – soaring.\\n\\nIn response, the editorial pages of UK newspapers – which serve as the formal “voice” of the publications and are sometimes referred to as “leaders” or “leading articles” – have been filled with proposed solutions to the crisis.\\n\\nCarbon Brief analysis of more than 400 climate- and energy-related newspaper editorials published in 2022 shows how some outlets have used the situation to push for fossil-fuel extraction, during a crisis caused almost entirely by rising fossil-fuel prices.\\n\\nFor example, it reveals unprecedented levels of lobbying by titles such as the Sun to reverse the government’s ban on fracking in England. This effort might have succeeded, were it not for the abrupt end to Liz Truss’s short spell as prime minister.\\n\\nThe popularity of nuclear power in the UK press also reached a record high in 2022. By contrast, support for renewables, such as wind and solar power, dipped, despite the vital role they are expected to play in weaning the UK off costly fossil gas.\\n\\nThis analysis builds on previous work published by Carbon Brief showing how the UK’s right-leaning newspapers had broadly been on a journey towards acceptance of climate policies over the past decade.\\n\\nEnergy crisis dominates\\n\\nOf the 413 climate- and energy-related editorials analysed by Carbon Brief in 2022, 149 addressed renewable energy, nuclear power and fracking – more than double the previous year.\\n\\nThe surge of interest in energy-related topics can be seen in the chart below.

The percentage of energy-related editorials that were pro-renewables fell from 57% to 38%, while the percentage of those that were anti-renewables increased from 7% to 15%.\\n\\nThis was largely due to right-leaning titles emphasising the “unreliability” of wind and solar power for providing the UK’s energy needs.\\n\\nEditorial in Daily Mail, 7 March 2022.\\n\\nIn fact, Carbon Brief’s analysis finds that, while 24 editorials explicitly recommended increasing UK gas extraction and 17 recommended nuclear power as solutions to the energy crisis in 2022, only six proposed building new renewable power capacity.\\n\\nFor a period at the start of the year, many right-leaning titles even suggested cutting “green levies” – which support low-carbon and social measures through people’s bills. For example, the Daily Mail ran an editorial in April titled: “Axe the green taxes.”\\n\\nThis was in spite of these levies making up just 3% of bills in October.

It has been banned in England since 2019, following extensive protests and minor earthquakes at drilling sites.\\n\\nYet, in 2022, right-leaning newspapers – especially the Sun, Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail – published unprecedented numbers of editorials praising fracking and calling for the ban to be overturned.\\n\\nThis can be seen in the chart below, with the Sun alone publishing more pro-fracking editorials in a single year than all UK newspapers combined have ever managed before – 32 in total.\\n\\nNumber of pro-fracking editorials in UK newspapers between 2011 and 2022.

By far the most common theme – appearing in 54 of the 69 editorials that mentioned fracking – was the need for shale gas to satisfy the UK’s energy needs.\\n\\nIn reality, extracting shale gas in the UK would be unlikely to yield significant benefits for either energy security or prices, especially in the short term.\\n\\nHowever, the lobbying barrage from one the nation’s most-read newspapers may have had some impact.\\n\\nExpert analysis direct to your inbox.

These include the perceived high costs of pursuing climate policies and the “eco-idiot” protesters pushing for more ambitious climate action in the UK.\\n\\nOne notable editorial in the Mail on Sunday took aim at the “astronomical costs of pursuing a net-zero utopia”.

Green hydrogen, in particular, defined as hydrogen produced from water electrolysis using renewable or low-carbon electricity, has received the lion’s share of attention. By comparison, little attention has been paid to biohydrogen (Bio-H2), a type of hydrogen produced from organic waste streams (e.g., agricultural waste) that can potentially yield a carbon-removing (or climate-positive) fuel when coupled with efficient CO2 absorption and subsequent storage. Indicatively, few hydrogen supply-and-demand forecasts or high-level hydrogen strategies mention it. However, Bio-H2 presents opportunities not only to establish a cyclical hydrogen system with waste converted into energy but also to address emissions that remain after all technically and economically feasible efforts have been made to eliminate them.\\n\\nThis report, part of the Carbon Management Initiative at the Center on Global Energy Policy, explores the current state of play for Bio-H2 and its potential contribution to decarbonization efforts. The report begins with an analysis of the varying definitions and categorization of Bio-H2 in the literature, which may relate to its classification as both a hydrogen and a bioenergy with a diverse selection of sources and manufacturing pathways. Next, it assesses the crucial question of Bio-H2’s carbon intensity, which has additional specifications to those of blue hydrogen (defined as hydrogen manufactured from natural gas with carbon capture and storage [CCS]) and green hydrogen production, including land use, land use change, use of dedicated fuel crops (and associated land use issues), status and footprint of wastes (agricultural, forestry, and municipal), and avoided or reduced methane emissions. The report shows that if the biomass feedstock is not carefully selected and the energy consumed during its processing is not closely monitored and controlled, Bio-H2’s carbon footprint can potentially exceed that of fossil-based hydrogen today. Therefore, to avoid any potential negative climate impacts from utilizing Bio-H2, the assessment and governance of biomass feedstock for Bio-H2 manufacturing is critical.\\n\\nThis report also shows that the potential carbon-removing value of Bio-H2, particularly the carbon-negative hydrogen derived from biomass wastes and CCS, far outweighs its energy value and that Bio-H2 can be manufactured using technologies that are relatively mature and near commercial stage. Nonetheless, because the carbon-negative value of Bio-H2 is contingent on the use of biomass wastes, which is a constrained resource, Bio-H2 should only be employed when the capacity of other decarbonization methods is limited. Key opportunities for its application present in hard-to-abate sectors with potential for manufacturing zero carbon or even carbon-negative steel or chemicals. In regions where waste biomass is abundant and underutilized (e.g., East or Southeast Asia), Bio-H2 can also enable a circular carbon economy and offer flexible carbon management solutions. For example, local food scraps and agricultural waste (e.g., rice husk) can be converted into fertilizers (created from hydrogen-derived ammonia), which can cut carbon emissions from food production.\\n\\nAt present, however, the wide deployment of carbon-negative Bio-H2 still faces considerable obstacles. If policy-makers and business leaders wish to overcome these obstacles, the following recommendations may be pertinent:\\n\\nIncorporate Bio-H2 manufactured from biomass wastes and CCS technologies into national hydrogen strategy and planning. With a potential carbon footprint of between around −21 kg-CO2/kg-H2 and −15 kg-CO2/kg-H2 (using a median estimation of life-cycle assessment and land use change), Bio-H2 manufactured in this way can offer a significant climate benefit.\\n\\nWith a potential carbon footprint of between around −21 kg-CO2/kg-H2 and −15 kg-CO2/kg-H2 (using a median estimation of life-cycle assessment and land use change), Bio-H2 manufactured in this way can offer a significant climate benefit. Apply Bio-H2 manufactured from biomass wastes coupled with CCS technologies as a deep decarbonization tool for hard-to-abate sectors. Carbon-negative Bio-H2 can potentially enable the production of zero carbon or even carbon-negative steel (−0.61 tCO2/t to 0.39 tCO2/t) and/or chemicals such as ammonia (−4.04 tCO2/t to −0.6 tCO2/t) and methanol (−3.89 tCO2/t to −0.17 tCO2/t) (see Table 5 for details).\\n\\nCarbon-negative Bio-H2 can potentially enable the production of zero carbon or even carbon-negative steel (−0.61 tCO2/t to 0.39 tCO2/t) and/or chemicals such as ammonia (−4.04 tCO2/t to −0.6 tCO2/t) and methanol (−3.89 tCO2/t to −0.17 tCO2/t) (see Table 5 for details). Establish standardized, verifiable, and transparent carbon-accounting methods as well as a governance infrastructure for biomass procurement and Bio-H2 production. These can help ensure that the use of Bio-H2 produces climate benefits and can help anchor agreements between suppliers, purchasers, and countries to prevent malpractices in the harvesting of biomass and miscalculation in the carbon accounting of Bio-H2’s footprint.\\n\\nThese can help ensure that the use of Bio-H2 produces climate benefits and can help anchor agreements between suppliers, purchasers, and countries to prevent malpractices in the harvesting of biomass and miscalculation in the carbon accounting of Bio-H2’s footprint. Introduce government incentives for the production and consumption of carbon-negative Bio-H2. Such incentives can encourage the production and use of carbon-negative Bio-H2 toward the development of a Bio-H2 market.\\n\\nSuch incentives can encourage the production and use of carbon-negative Bio-H2 toward the development of a Bio-H2 market. Encourage government investment in and policy support for: Enhancing waste management infrastructure and the collection and usage rate of biomass wastes. This can help to eliminate the widespread burning and landfill disposal of biomass waste, including crop residue and municipal solid waste, which leads to air and water pollution and additional greenhouse gas emissions. Improving Bio-H2 production technologies, particularly for gasification. This can help to address remaining barriers to scaling up certain thermochemical Bio-H2 production technologies, including catalyst fouling, inconsistent feedstock quality, and gas cleaning, as well as metabolic technology pathways, which are still subjected to low volumetric and subject-specific yields. Further reducing Bio-H2 production costs, which will require a lower feedstock cost across regions and a reduced CAPEX cost from improved and scaled biomass gasification technology. This can help make Bio-H2 consistently cost-competitive at $2/kg-H2. Currently, production costs for Bio-H2 range widely ($1.25–$10.51/kg-H2). The lower-range costs are comparable to the mean costs of gray hydrogen ($0.5–$2/kg-H2), but they are limited to regions with cheap and abundant biomass supplies situated within a short distance of the manufacturing site.\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLow-carbon hydrogen, or hydrogen produced with little to no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has emerged as an attractive solution in the transition to a net-zero carbon economy. By potentially reducing, recycling, reusing, or removing emissions while retaining the key functions and features of existing infrastructure, it can critically enhance efforts at decarbonization around the world. This report, which builds on a prior report by the Carbon Management Initiative focused on green hydrogen (2021), puts the spotlight on biohydrogen (Bio-H2), or hydrogen synthesized through either metabolic or the thermochemical conversion of biomass feedstocks, as a potentially carbon-negative hydrogen source. The focus, therefore, is on Bio-H2 produced from waste biomass feedstocks with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in particular, which can potentially contribute to a circular carbon economy.[i]\\n\\nAs this report seeks to show, Bio-H2 is different from other forms of low-carbon hydrogen (e.g., green hydrogen produced from water electrolysis with low-carbon electricity and blue hydrogen produced from natural gas with CCS) due to its unique technical, economic, operational, and governance characteristics. Most significantly, unlike its counterparts, Bio-H2 can potentially be carbon negative when combined with CCS. By furnishing energy while quickly removing substantial amounts of carbon from the air and oceans, Bio-H2 can be a critical tool for policy-makers and business leaders invested in achieving net-zero targets. Importantly, though, Bio-H2’s carbon-negative potential is dependent on: 1) securing biomass feedstocks with extremely low-carbon footprints, such as agricultural or municipal waste, manure, or sewages, and 2) using production technology that is compatible with CCS at a high rate of capture.\\n\\nThe report begins by introducing the complexity of using biomass as a feedstock. It then discusses the current status of Bio-H2 in the literature and future energy scenarios. Finally, the report reviews the existing literature on the technologies, costs, and carbon footprints of Bio-H2 and examines core challenges to its expansion at a scale that would allow it to contribute to net-zero emissions scenarios.\\n\\nDefinition and Classification of Biohydrogen\\n\\nIn line with recent literature (Kumar and Sarkar 2011; Mohan and Pandey 2013; S. C. Bhatia 2014), this report defines Bio-H2 as the synthesis of H2 gas through both biological production and the thermochemical conversion of biomass feedstocks. This definition of Bio-H2 is wider in scope than that of an earlier literature, which assumed that the term “Bio-H2” is limited to hydrogen produced biologically (Levin et al. 2004).\\n\\nThere has been considerable confusion over the nomenclature around hydrogen. Bio-H2 is often regarded as a type of “green hydrogen,” a term that tends to be used interchangeably with “renewable hydrogen.” In reality, however, Bio-H2 and green hydrogen are both “renewable” forms of hydrogen but are distinguishable from each other. The European Commission rightly defines “renewable hydrogen” as H2 produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity (i.e., what is typically considered “green hydrogen”) or through biogas reforming or biochemical conversion of biomass (i.e., Bio-H2).\\n\\nBecause Bio-H2 is a form of both hydrogen and bioenergy, there has likewise been confusion around how to classify it. For instance, the accelerated and net-zero scenarios of BP’s Energy Outlook 2022 feature a brief discussion of Bio-H2 labeled “BECCS” that lists it as both a type of demand for bioenergy and part of a projection for future low-carbon hydrogen supply (BP 2022). Princeton’s Net-Zero America report gives Bio-H2, labeled “BECCS-H2,” an important role in its 2050 H2 projection and recognizes it as one of the key technologies for biomass use in 2050 scenarios. The significance of Bio-H2 in achieving climate neutrality is not explicitly acknowledged in similar reports, however. The IEA’s Net-Zero 2050 scenario analysis and the IRENA’s World Energy Transition 2022 report, for instance, do not mention Bio-H2 expressly in their future scenario analyses. These discrepancies and omissions are indicative of the lack of recognition of Bio-H2’s potential as a climate mitigation method among industry leaders and government bodies.\\n\\nBiohydrogen Production: Technical Overview\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCompared to fossil-based hydrogen, Bio-H2 has the potential to have an extremely low-carbon footprint: Bio-H2 produced with low-carbon biomass feedstocks and renewable energy can be nearly carbon neutral; when its production in this manner is paired with CCS, it can be net carbon negative, effectively removing CO2 from the atmosphere (Baker et al. 2020; Sandalow et al. 2020). The carbon-negative property of Bio-H2 is, however, dependent on which biomass inputs and conversion techniques are used.\\n\\nA variety of biomass feedstocks and technical methods can be used to produce Bio-H2, leading to a wide range of carbon intensities. In attempt to provide a complete picture of Bio-H2’s carbon emissions profile, the following section performs a technical evaluation of Bio-H2 production techniques and associated biomass feedstocks.\\n\\nFeedstock and Bioenergy Product Types\\n\\nA broad definition of biomass includes all organic material found on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. Biomass feedstock can thus be diverse in form and sources, resulting in a complex LCA and LUC profile. Previous studies have categorized biomass feedstock differently based on specific biomass features such as level of effect on global food and agricultural systems (e.g., first through fourth generation) (Dutta et al. 2014) or origin and function (e.g., forest biomass versus aquatic biomass) (Sikarwar et al. 2017). This study instead classifies biomass by its harvesting method, using the following categories:\\n\\nLignocellulosic (woody) biomass: the most common type of biomass for energy production (e.g., wood pellets). Energy crops: oil, sugar, and starch crops cultivated for dedicated energy uses using crop lands. Biodegradable wastes: agricultural and wood wastes/residue, animal manure, municipal solid wastes, and sewage sludge that typically have very little economic value or have minimal environmental impact in current economic models. Photosynthetic microorganisms: a distinct way of producing Bio-H2 through bio-photochemical routes using light energy as a primary input.\\n\\nIn addition to having diverse origins, biomass feedstocks can be converted into a range of bioenergy products beyond Bio-H2 and employed in a variety of applications such as heat and power, biodiesel, bioethanol, methanol and dimethyl ether (DME), other liquid fuels, and biomethane (see Figure 1). The latter, which is chemically identical to methane, is an upgraded form of biogas that is typically produced from biomass-based wastes such as manure or sewage sludge through anaerobic digestion. As a biomass-based energy product and a potential feedstock for Bio-H2 production, its sources, carbon footprint, and conversion pathway to Bio-H2 will be discussed here separately.\\n\\nBiohydrogen Production Pathways\\n\\nBio-H2 can be produced either biologically or thermochemically. Biological Bio-H2 production routes include fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and biophotolysis, all of which involve microorganisms; thermochemical Bio-H2 production routes include biomass gasification, pyrolysis, and steam (bio)methane reforming. In general, thermochemical processes are far more technologically advanced than biological processes (see Figure 2). Due to their low cost and high efficiency, they have also garnered greater attention (Kumar et al. 2020). Thermochemical processes represent a near-term prospect for industrial-scale Bio-H2 production from biomass (wood, straw, grass clippings, etc.) or other bioenergy sources (e.g., biomethane/biogas).\\n\\n\\n\\nBiohydrogen Production—Thermochemical Conversion Routes\\n\\nThe three most prominent thermochemical conversion routes are gasification, pyrolysis, and steam (bio)methane reforming. The efficiency and yield of the products produced via each of these pathways largely depends on the feedstock used.\\n\\nBiomass Gasification\\n\\nAmong the thermochemical processes for biomass conversion, gasification is the oldest, the most well established, and, by many estimates, among the most efficient biomass-to-fuel conversion methods (Kumar et al. 2020; Glushkov et al. 2021). Through a controlled process using heat (600 to >1000°C), steam, and oxygen, it can convert a variety of biomass sources into hydrogen and other gaseous products without combustion (DOE, n.d.; Molino et al. 2016). This form of conversion via partial oxidation has been used to produce syngas (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide [CO], and traces of carbon dioxide [CO2]), which is then separated into a purified stream of H2 gas and a concentrated stream of CO2 suitable for CCS. A dedicated Bio-H2 production gasification facility can minimize the production of unwanted gases and solids while increasing the Bio-H2 yield (Cao et al. 2020). Such a facility can also be retrofitted with a CCS unit, making the Bio-H2 greatly carbon negative (see the “CCS Opportunity” section below).\\n\\nThe main advantages of the gasification production route are its feasibility for industrial applications, potential to process high moisture content biomass waste, and ability to eliminate odors and pathogens when treating animal manure (Kumar et al. 2020). When solid biomass is used as an input for gasification technology, which can accept a variety of biomass feedstock forms, it can potentially create high Bio-H2 yield. However, the gasification production route still faces major barriers in regard to feedstock quality control (i.e., removing inorganic constituents from the feedstock), catalyst corrosion or fouling, tar formation, and the separation of H2 gas from many other compounds in the off-gases (Kumar et al. 2020).\\n\\nBiomass Pyrolysis\\n\\nThe pyrolysis process involves heating biomass (200–600°C) in the absence of oxygen (Wang et al. 2020). Currently in the demonstration phase though approaching the commercial phase (see Figure 2), this pathway produces solid biochar, liquid bio-oil, and non-condensable gas products, including Bio-H2 (Kan et al. 2016). Operational conditions such as heating rate and solid residence time greatly affect product types and quantity. Fast pyrolysis targets liquid fuels as the output, whereas slow pyrolysis often targets solid biochar. Different temperatures and catalysts can drive the pyrolysis reaction in favor of H2 production, but the H2 yield is lower than that of gasification due to the absence of steam and oxygen (Wang et al. 2020). Compared to gasification, pyrolysis has advantages such as less land requirement, less pollutant emission, and more flexible end-product type but faces similar challenges such as tar formation (10–35 percent) (Kumar et al. 2020) as well as other issues such as high corrosiveness and low heat stability (Glushkov et al. 2021; Ruan et al. 2020). Moreover, the hydrogen concentration in its gaseous products is insufficient to make it a financially viable hydrogen production process (Chen et al. 2021).\\n\\nBiomethane Reforming\\n\\nSteam methane reforming (SMR) is currently the most widely used pathway by far for H2 production (approximately 97 percent) (IEA 2021a). Given that the methane molecules it uses are the same as those for biomethane and natural gas fossil methane, there is little technical difference between these reforming pathways (Blumberg 2018). Feeding biomethane instead only affects the cost of energy and the carbon footprint of methane itself. However, biomethane, which is purified from biogas, also has other major uses such as the direct substitution of natural gas (e.g., Europe has over 20,000 biogas/biomethane plants in operation, mainly for power or heat generation [EBA 2022]). As a result, biogas is a valuable resource in and of itself and should be prioritized for its immediate applications over and above the production of Bio-H2.\\n\\nBiohydrogen Production—Biological Conversion Routes\\n\\nBiological conversion routes include fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and biochemical reactions. Fermentation is the most promising metabolic pathway for hydrogen production due to its high net energy ratio. But all biological pathways are subjected to very low volumetric and substrate-specific yield. Other than (dark) fermentation, these pathways remain low on the TRL scale.\\n\\nFermentation and Anaerobic Digestion[v]\\n\\nFermentation is the most mature biological pathway (TRL 7) for consuming biomass feedstocks to produce Bio-H2 as well as other products such as methane and CO2 (Ghimire et al. 2015). Among the various forms of fermentation, dark fermentation is considered especially promising due to its high net energy ratio of 1.9 (SMR 0.64) (Łukajtis et al. 2018). This process involves converting biomass feedstocks using anaerobic bacteria grown in the dark via glycolysis. Similar to biomass pyrolysis, several end-products of this pathway limit the overall Bio-H2 yield and energy efficiency. Extra costs and energy must also be added to account for product separation and upgrading (Vane 2005). Another form, photo-fermentation, proceeds through a series of biochemical reactions involving a diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria in the presence of light. This process, however, has low conversion efficiency and poor performance (Hitam and Jalil 2020).\\n\\nAnaerobic digestion is typically used for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biogas (a mixture of biomethane and CO2) (Sawatdeenarunat et al. 2015). The technology The technology of anaerobic digestion for Bio-H2 is still under development (TRL 6). A two-phase system of anaerobic digestion has the advantage of producing hydrogen and methane simultaneously (H2-methane coproduction), but most bioenergy is carried by the biomethane production rather than the Bio-H2 production, a critical disadvantage compared to dedicated Bio-H2 production pathways (Demirel, Scherer, Yenigun, and Onay 2010). It is worth noting that the biomethane could be used produce Bio-H2 via reforming (referring to biomethane reforming pathway).\\n\\nBio-photochemical Reaction\\n\\nBio-photochemical reaction, or biophotolysis, is the production of hydrogen using only water and sunlight. This process involves water dissociating into molecular hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of light with the aid of microorganisms or other mediums such as catalysts (Anisha and John 2014). Although typically considered a potential pathway of Bio-H2 production, bio-photochemical reaction does not require the input of biomass as a feedstock, which is a potential advantage. For now, however, its production rates remain low and the technology is limited to lab-scale research (TRL 3, which is the lowest level among all the Bio-H2 production pathways; see Figure 3). The cost and carbon footprint of bio-photochemical reaction also remain largely unknown.\\n\\nOverall, although biological production methods of Bio-H2 show promise, they are still largely in lab-scale research stage with low volumetric and substrate-specific yields. Anaerobic digestion and biophotolysis, in particular, require more development and face the challenge of not being dedicated to Bio-H2 production technology and a low TRL, respectively. Biomass pyrolysis and fermentation are both near commercial stage, but currently the most mature and technologically available routes are biomass gasification and biomethane reforming, which is a limited resource with competitive uses. Therefore, gasification remains the most promising pathway for Bio-H2 production.\\n\\nComparative Analysis of Biohydrogen Production Pathways\\n\\nTable 2 below summarizes and compares the key parameters of the six Bio-H2 production pathways.\\n\\nThe costs associated with each pathway may vary greatly depending on level of technology readiness, infrastructure support, and availability of biomass feedstock. Gasification, pyrolysis, biomethane SMR, and biophotolysis have low-range costs (approximately $1.25–$1.4/kg) that are comparable to the mean cost of gray hydrogen ($0.5–$2/kg) today (see Table 2 and 3). However, these low costs are contingent on cheap and abundant biomass supplies situated within a short distance of the manufacturing site. Meanwhile, the highest cost ranges of gasification, pyrolysis, biomethane SMR/autothermal reforming (ATR), and fermentation are consistent with high ranges of green hydrogen costs ($8–$10/kg).\\n\\nThe carbon footprints across pathways have a wide range (−26.5 to 10.8 kgCO2/kgH2; see Table 2), including negative values obtained either through CCS or carbon sequestration through biochar. The highest ranges are consistent with current gray hydrogen values (>10kg-CO2/kg-H2), which correspond to the earlier discussion about how using biomass feedstocks with high LCA and LUC values for Bio-H2, production can exceed the carbon intensity of today’s fossil-based hydrogen.\\n\\n\\n\\nCCS Opportunity: Biomass Gasification Costs and Carbon Footprint\\n\\nThis section focuses explicitly on biomass gasification. In general, it is thermodynamically advantageous to the carbon capture process if the gas mixture to be separated already contains a high concentration of CO2 (Ghiat and Al-Ansari 2021). As observed in the previous review, the solid biomass gasification pathway shows the greatest promise for Bio-H2 production, with a high Bio-H2 yield, a concentrated CO2 stream for CCS compatibility, reasonable costs (i.e., low-range values; see Table 2), and a spectrum of possible biomass feedstock selections. Like SMR, biomethane reforming is a production method that offers CCS compatibility. However, aside from dedicated Bio-H2 production, biomethane is a limited resource with numerous existing competitive applications. Biomass gasification, on the other hand, has widely available feedstock sources and high CCS compatibility. Given these advantages, this section examines the cost and carbon footprint of Bio-H2 production associated with biomass gasification.\\n\\nBiomass gasification typically involves several steps: feedstock preparation, feedstock gasification, gas cleanup, and separation (IEA Bioenergy 2018). The latter step refers to the separation of Bio-H2 from other gases, which naturally yields a high-concentration stream of CO2 that in turn poses a relatively low-cost opportunity for integrating a CCS unit. Different configurations of technology and carbon management methods yield different costs and carbon footprints (Salkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean 2018). Depending on its design, the gasification process may require additional heat from extra biomass or fossil energy, resulting in a different biomass consumption rate, carbon footprint, and cost of production (Salkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean 2018). However, in general, the unit abatement cost for Bio-H2 with CCS ($/ton-CO2) is among the lowest of all CCS applications (Rubin et al. 2015). Therefore, Bio-H2 with carbon-removing potential may prove a near-term opportunity that can play a vital role in achieving net-zero emission goals (Larson et al. 2021).\\n\\nMost existing biomass gasification plants consist of downdraft fixed-bed gasifiers designed for syngas production (i.e., the production of H2 and CO mixtures and associated gas-turbine electricity generation) (Pandey et al. 2015). Compared with gasification of other feedstocks such as coal or heavy oils, the quality control of biomass resources is complex and uncertain, requiring a more complicated plant design and therefore driving up the overall cost. More compact advanced technologies such as fluidized bed (FB) and entrained flow (EF) are better suited for biomass gasification and associated H2 purification and CO2 removal (X. Lu et al. 2019). Salkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean (2018) evaluated the CCS option for biomass gasification using FB and EF gasification technologies for their experimentally verified performance in commercial applications. Fixed/moving-bed downdraft and updraft gasification configurations have simpler design principles than FB and EF but require longer residence time and have a lower conversion rate. They have been found to be more suitable for smaller scale power generation instead of dedicated Bio-H2 production (Siedlecki et al. 2011; Warnecke 2000).\\n\\n\\n\\nSalkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean (2018) estimate that using minimal fossil energy for Bio-H2 production through either FB or EF gasification technologies results in a slightly negative carbon footprint for Bio-H2 even absent CCS units (assuming the biomass feedstock and bioenergy used are strictly carbon neutral as biomass wastes). Equipped with CCS units, Bio-H2 production can be greatly carbon negative (−21.8 to −15.8 kg-CO2/ kg-H2) , with the same assumptions in place). The life-cycle footprint of biomass is sensitive to many factors, however (Cherubini et al. 2009; Fritsche and Wiegmann 2009; Shen et al. 2015), and the value of Bio-H2 (and biomass in general) is directly tied to its life-cycle emissions and the fuel it displaces (Sandalow et al. 2020).\\n\\nLUC and LCA’s Impact on Biohydrogen’s Carbon Footprint\\n\\nThe following section summarizes the results of multiple studies to compare and contrast the impact of land use change (LUC) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) on Bio-H2’s total carbon footprint. Studies on the carbon footprint of Bio-H2 from biomass gasification report similarly low LCA results (see Figure 3), ranging from 0.75 kg-CO2-eq/kg-H2 to 2.1 kg-CO2-eq/kg-H2, which is competitive with blue and green hydrogen regardless of the gasification process and feedstock used. This analysis shows that the impact of necessary fossil energy input on the gasification of Bio-H2 is small, posing minimal climate risk. Bio-H2 production from biomass gasification is among the lowest carbon intensity production pathways from a strictly LCA perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom an LUC perspective, the picture looks very different (see Figure 4); Drews, Larsen, and Balderrama (2020) show that LUC-induced carbon emissions (median value) from all types of biomass feedstock greatly increase the total carbon emissions of Bio-H2 production from biomass gasification, except those from confirmed “wastes and residuals.” To account for the high uncertainty of LUC, the authors selected the results in the 25–75 percentile range (LUC values of the middle 50 percent), eliminating the effect of outliers. For most widely used woody crops, Bio-H2 LUC-induced carbon emission can contribute to roughly half of the emissions from SMR baseline, greatly damaging the carbon credit expected from biomass (Drews, Larsen, and Balderrama 2020). For Bio-H2 production from biomass gasification, LUC poses more uncertainty and damage to the environment than LCA.\\n\\nFigure 5 below summarizes the carbon emissions from both LCA and LUC using woody biomass feedstocks. Compared with LCA’s emissions, LUC’s are higher and have much greater uncertainty. Although both LCA and LUC add to the GHG emissions of Bio-H2 production, the incorporation of carbon capture can enable net-negative emissions for Bio-H2, even in the worst LCA and LUC scenarios.\\n\\nFigure 6 summarizes the carbon intensity of Bio-H2 production using waste biomass such as agricultural residuals or forest wastes instead of woody biomass. Due to waste biomass’s low LUC, this type of Bio-H2 production can have a near-zero carbon footprint; if combined with CCS, it can have a greatly negative carbon footprint, resulting in approximately 150 to 200 percent emissions reduction compared with gray H2 (i.e., abating twice as much GHG as gray H2).\\n\\nCost Breakdown for Biohydrogen via Biomass Gasification\\n\\nFor Bio-H2 production from biomass gasification, feedstock and capital expenditure (CAPEX) make up the overwhelming majority of the total cost (Salkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean 2018; Sara et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019). Figure 7 (detailed in Table A-6) shows the results of different techno-economic analyses of Bio-H2 production via biomass gasification, which vary dramatically. A deeper look at the results reveals that operational expenditure (OPEX) remains relatively stable across studies: the cost of biomass feedstock is in the range of $0.50 to $2.50 $/kg-H2 ; and other OPEX components such as additional energy costs (for co-gasification) and O&M costs contribute 20 to 30 percent of the total cost (Salkuyeh, Saville, and MacLean 2018; Sara et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019).\\n\\nThe biggest uncertainty around the cost of Bio-H2 production through biomass gasification is CAPEX. By way of example, (Sara et al. 2016) shows that a small-scale (0.1 MW thermal power scale) biomass gasification plant can greatly increase the per-unit hydrogen production CAPEX compared with larger plants. This finding directly indicates how to further reduce the cost of Bio-H2 production through biomass gasification: the systematic improvement of gasification plant design to reduce CAPEX. Other ways of driving down CAPEX are improved infrastructure such as CCS support and larger production scale.\\n\\nChallenges remain for biomass gasification methods. (Cao et al. 2020) found that finding cost-effective catalysts for reaction temperature decrease and tar cracking is the greatest challenge to future biomass gasification, pointing to plant design and CAPEX components.\\n\\nBiohydrogen: Pathways Comparison from a Cost Perspective\\n\\nConsolidating information from Table 1 and the aforementioned analysis on biomass gasification, Figure 8 displays the carbon footprint versus cost of Bio-H2 produced via different pathways. Biomass gasification (woody biomass feedstocks) shows the lowest possible overall carbon footprint while maintaining a reasonably low cost of $3–4/kg-H2.\\n\\nSteam reforming of biomethane is also a promising technology that is compatible with CCS. Studies have shown that SMR of biomethane with CCS can potentially generate Bio-H2 with a negative carbon footprint and at a lower cost than gasification of woody biomass with CCS (see Figure 8). However, biomethane has competitive uses, such as directly substituting natural gas. As a result, biomethane is a valuable resource in and of itself, and should be prioritized for its most immediate applications above and beyond the production of Bio-H2. Other production pathways without CCS are all still carbon positive and can be optimally near carbon neutral if the biomass feedstock itself is carbon neutral and the production process is strictly low carbon.\\n\\nBio-H2 Application Opportunities\\n\\nBio-H2 is identical to other hydrogen atoms (gray, blue, green) from a chemical and physical standpoint, meaning it can be used for any potential hydrogen application. The greatest advantage of biomass-based hydrogen, however, is not as an energy or energy-carrying product per se, but its ability to remove carbon when coupled with CCS. As such, its utility should be considered independently from that of other forms of low-carbon hydrogen (i.e., green hydrogen or blue hydrogen). When produced from waste and coupled with CCS, Bio-H2[vi] can potentially be profoundly carbon negative, provide additional climate benefits to its users, and assist sectors with limited decarbonization options achieve carbon neutrality by compensating for difficult-to-eliminate residual emissions.\\n\\nIn general, hydrogen can immediately replace natural gas as a heating source for industrial operations that demand huge volumes of thermal energy at high temperatures (e.g., blast furnaces) (Friedmann et al. 2019; Sandalow et al. 2020). It can also reduce carbon emissions and air pollution in the long-haul transportation and marine shipping industries or be used as a medium for long-term storage of renewable energy to help address the latter’s seasonality and variable availability (Schiavo and Nietvelt 2020). Finally, hydrogen can be used in a fuel cell for backup power or to power vehicles such as private cars, trucks, buses, and marine vessels.\\n\\nUnique Bio-H2 application opportunities exist in harder-to-abate sectors. One example is the iron and steel industry. Most of the emissions from this sector’s existing facilities are attributable to blast furnace rather than electricity, which accounts for only about 13 percent of the industry’s total emissions (Fan and Friedmann 2021). As a result, renewable electricity plays a minor role in decarbonizing this sector. At present, BF-BOF[vii] remains the primary method of steel production (accounting for approximately 71 percent of all steel), and there is limited opportunity to use hydrogen in BF-BOF instead of coking coal.\\n\\nAmong all steel manufacturing pathways, the most mature low-emission technique is currently green hydrogen-based DRI (direct reduced iron) combined with an EAF (electric arc furnace) powered by zero-carbon electricity (Fan and Friedmann 2021; Hoffmann et al. 2020).[viii] Applying Bio-H2 (assumed to be produced from gasification using waste feedstocks with CCS) can effectively double the carbon credit of hydrogen injection for both BF-BOF and DRI. In the case of DRI-EAF, it can achieve net carbon-negative steel (−0.6 ton-CO2/ton-steel). This poses a unique opportunity to use Bio-H2 to achieve net-zero or net-negative emissions for a harder-to-abate sector (see Table 5).\\n\\nAnother example is the chemical industry, which continues to represent a serious hurdle for deep decarbonization plans. In SMR-based ammonia production,[ix] H2 production is responsible for a significant portion of the final ammonia carbon footprint. Consequently, using external, low-carbon hydrogen as a feedstock can drastically reduce ammonia’s CO2 emissions (Woodall et al. 2022). When CCS-generated Bio-H2 is used, the carbon-negative H2 enables the production of carbon-negative ammonia (see Table 5). Similarly, the ethylene-synthesis process lends itself well to hydrogen-based heat generation because it already uses fossil-based gases, including H2, to heat the steam cracker and other process units; by using carbon-negative Bio-H2 instead, the final ethylene product can potentially achieve a negative carbon footprint (−2.93 t-CO2/t-Eth) (see Table 5). Other chemicals that can similarly use a hydrogen feedstock to potentially have a large impact on emissions include ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH).\\n\\nAlthough Bio-H2 is currently not as cost competitive as gray hydrogen, its cost varies widely depending on location and manufacturing process. In places with access to low-cost and abundant biomass waste feedstocks, the cost of Bio-H2 can be comparable to that of blue and green hydrogen, and on rare occasions, to that of gray hydrogen (see Tables 2 and 3). The wide range in the cost of Bio-H2 also underlines regional opportunities—in areas with an abundance of waste biomass resources and access to geological disposal of CO2, there is potential to utilize biomass waste for local energy consumption while also contributing directly to climate change mitigation at a low cost (see Appendix, Table A-1). This enables a system of circularity that transforms waste products into fresh resources.\\n\\nIn the context of urban and city planning, Bio-H2 can be produced from municipal solid waste or sewage sludge to provide fuel for the city’s long-haul vehicles or to provide heating. This would reduce the amount of transportation needed for the import and delivery of fuel in the city as well as the overall carbon footprint. Bio-H2 can also play a role in reducing the overall energy consumption linked to food production. Currently, hydrogen is most commonly used to manufacture ammonia and its derivative—nitrogen fertilizer—which are vital to global food production, accounting for roughly half of total hydrogen consumption worldwide. Various streams of organic waste from different points in the food supply chain, including crop residues (upstream), animal manures (upstream), and food waste (downstream), can be used as feedstocks to produce Bio-H2. This hydrogen can in turn be used as both heat and a feedstock for fertilizer production, reducing the overall carbon footprint of the food system.\\n\\nChallenges\\n\\nFurther Improvement of Gasification Technology\\n\\nThe thermochemical synthesis of Bio-H2 from diverse organic biomass is widely regarded as a promising and economically viable technology. The benefits of this method include higher product yield and flexibility with the currently available infrastructure. For Bio-H2 synthesis on a large scale, however, challenges remain. The process still needs to be optimized to reduce the energy loss caused by pretreating the biomass prior to the conversion process, optimizing the conversion efficiency in the reactor, reducing tar formation, and improving gas cleaning for H2 gas separation and further processing. Other challenges include fluctuation in equipment costs, availability of feedstocks, and inconsistent feedstock quality. Catalyst contamination/fouling likewise must be solved, making catalyst optimization critical (Kumar et al. 2020).\\n\\nBiomass Gasification’s Environmental Impacts\\n\\nThe environmental impacts of gasification plants still need to be evaluated. The thermochemical conversion of biomass typically generates unwanted contaminates such as soot, char particles, ash, and condensable hydrocarbons, which pollute the air and water (Barahmand and Eikeland 2022). If this technology is to be used at a wide scale, the emissions and by-product disposal of biomass gasification plants will require careful supervision and the implementation of adequate and effective preventive measures.\\n\\nCompeting Uses of Biomass Resources\\n\\nBiomass resources, especially biomass with minimal environmental impact such as wastes and residuals, have production limits that prevent them from being used as a primary source of energy. Harvesting additional biomass greater than the sustainable limits may lead to deforestation or competing use of land for food production or other agricultural activities. Biomass itself can also be used for purposes other than being converted into hydrogen. These include power generation (e.g., biogas/biomethane for electricity generation), industrial applications (e.g., producing biochar or biocoke to replace coal), or as biofuel in transport (road, aviation, and shipping). Many outlooks envisage such uses of biomass (IEA 2019), which may be preferred by industrial players and policy-makers because most of them can be implemented right away to address the immediate policy need of diversification. The REPowerEU strategy envisages that biomethane production can increase to 35 bcm by 2030, thereby replacing natural gas use in the medium term without having to adapt the transport infrastructure or change how end users consume the fuel.\\n\\nThough the aim of this report is not to compare different uses of biomass resources, particularly those that yield the lowest carbon footprint, previous analyses showed that Bio-H2 has unique merits in its adaptability to different biomass resources as well as carbon removal potential. As such, it can be considered a key option for the energy transition and climate mitigation.\\n\\nBiomass Resources Limitations\\n\\nDespite the numerous advantages of Bio-H2, the biomass feedstock on which it relies is not distributed equally around the globe. Certain regions (i.e., South America and Southeast Asia) have abundant resources whereas others (i.e., Europe, Japan, and South Korea) are constrained (see Appendix, Table A-1). Globally, there is potential for 130–300 Mt/y of hydrogen production using biomass wastes and residual biomass with minimal environmental impact (Sandalow et al. 2020), providing CO2 removal potential of 2.14–7.56 Gt CO2/y (assuming all biomass is used for Bio-H2 production). As a greatly carbon-negative source of hydrogen, Bio-H2 can potentially play an important role in decarbonization and the creation of a circular carbon economy.\\n\\nThis unequal geographical distribution of biomass is a result not only of differences in the availability of biomass potentials but also the current collection and utilization rate of biomass residues. In Asia, for instance, China produces the most agricultural waste and crop residues (followed by India), with more than 600 million tons annually from the production of rice, corn, and wheat alone (Jiang et al. 2022). Yet, the majority of these residues are incinerated or landfilled, leading to unnecessary waste and additional GHG emissions. Increasing the utilization rate of biomass residues is therefore also the key to enabling the full potential of Bio-H2 (Shapiro-Bengtsen 2020).\\n\\nLimitations on the Availability of Geology for CO2 Disposal\\n\\nBio-H2 has the greatest value when combined with CCS technologies for carbon-negative hydrogen production, naturally making CCS resources another limitation. The total capacity of the earth’s crust to store CO2 is effectively limitless—estimated at 10–20 trillion tons (C. P. Consoli and Wildgust 2017; Kearns et al. 2017). In addition, the technologies and tools of carbon management for geological CO2 storage are well known and understood (Global CCS Institute 2021b; IEA 2021c). However, the geographical distribution of CO2 storage sites is uneven. Several regions combine high Bio-H2 production potential with high CO2 storage potential (Minervini et al. 2021; Sandalow et al. 2020). These include the southeastern and central US (Baik et al. 2018), Southeast Asia (Hasbollah and Junin 2017; World Bank 2015), the North Sea region (Minervini et al. 2021), California (Tubbesing et al. 2020), and Alberta (Bachu 2003; NETL 2015). The rest of the world will need extra CCS infrastructure such as CO2 transportation pipelines to support the deployment of Bio-H2 with CCS.\\n\\nPolicy Support Limitations\\n\\nThe value of Bio-H2 (and biomass in general) ties directly to its life-cycle emissions (Sandalow et al. 2020). The life-cycle footprint of biomass is sensitive to many factors (Cherubini et al. 2009; Fritsche and Wiegmann 2009; Shen et al. 2015). When waste serves as a biomass feedstock, the life-cycle footprint is generally estimated to be very low and potentially CO2 removing (Thakur et al. 2014). However, researchers disagree on the status of biomass as waste (Langholtz et al. 2016; B. Liu and Rajagopal 2019). Even when biomass is acknowledged as such, questions remain about possible carbon “leakage” due to project expansion and associated deforestation or land degradation (Bird et al. 2011).\\n\\nWhile LCA estimates of biomass from waste are relatively straightforward, those of biomass produced from agricultural crops for fuel are more complicated (Rodionova et al. 2017). In the latter case, land is altered to grow crops, sometimes through plowing or deforestation, which releases carbon into the atmosphere. Watering, harvesting, transporting, and converting biomass also emits CO2 that must be accounted for in the life cycle. If the biofuel crop displaces food crops, leakage effects can be profound and lead to an increase in overall emissions due to substantial land use changes (Searchinger et al. 2008).\\n\\nIt is possible to mitigate these impacts and maximize life-cycle carbon reduction and removal through careful application of governance and technology (Bastos Lima 2009; 2021). Unfortunately, biomass production has a poor record of stewardship (Correa et al. 2019). Many documented examples exist of damage to local ecosystems (Efroymson and Langholtz 2017), harm to local communities (van der Horst and Vermeylen 2011), and eco-colonialism (Havnevik et al. 2011; Howes et al. 2016). Similarly, it is clear that carbon accounting of biomass feedstocks, both fuel crops and wastes, often fails to include carbon leakage or persistent carbon degradation (e.g., through peatland oxidation). Bio-H2 production and procurement standards would help to avoid these poor outcomes (Sandalow et al. 2020).\\n\\nLack of Developed Emission-Accounting Method for Bioenergy and Biomass Systems\\n\\nAlthough emission-accounting methods for bioenergy and biomass systems have been discussed widely in both academia and the business world and are an active area of research, they are still in development. Given the continued absence of such methods, it is important to point out that the misinterpretation or miscounting of negative emissions can have unintended, and possibly dangerous, consequences such as the introduction of policy incentives that reward increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations under the guise of negative emissions (Tanzer and Ramirez 2019).\\n\\nFindings\\n\\nFinding 1: Bio-H2 is not receiving sufficient attention from policy-makers and industry leaders, despite its carbon removal potential. For example, it was not recognized in major reports such as the IEA’s Net-Zero 2050 Scenario and IRENA’s World Energy Transition 2022. Other reports such as BP’s (2022) Energy Outlook 2022 acknowledge Bio-H2 as a hydrogen source but discuss it only briefly within the hydrogen projection of their accelerated and net-zero scenarios. Princeton’s (2022) Net-Zero America report, by contrast, lends Bio-H2 a prominent role in future energy forecast as a form of bioenergy. That the Princeton report remains an exception demonstrates Bio-H2’s lack of recognition as a climate mitigation solution.\\n\\nFinding 2: Bio-H2 can be generated from diverse biomass feedstocks, but these feedstocks are linked to different carbon emissions levels. If they are to play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, rigorous governance and standardized, verifiable, and transparent carbon-accounting methods for biomass procurement and Bio-H2 production will be necessary. Absent these measures, the carbon footprint of Bio-H2 could potentially exceed that of fossil-based hydrogen today.\\n\\nFinding 3: Bio-H2 manufactured from biomass wastes and CCS can potentially provide significant climate benefits. Carbon-negative hydrogen can potentially be produced by using waste biomass combined with CCS technology. The medium estimation of the carbon footprint of Bio-H2 produced in this way is −21kg-CO2/kg-H2 to −15 kg-CO2/kg- H2, meaning it can be used as an energy source while removing carbon from the atmosphere.\\n\\nFinding 4: Bio-H2 can be generated from a wide range of technologies, of which biomass gasification is among the most promising. This is due to its 1) compatibility with CCS; 2) flexibility to accommodate a wide range of biomass feedstocks (liquid and solid); 3) relative technical maturity; and 4) relatively low cost. When this technique is combined with the use of biomass wastes and CCS, the resulting Bio-H2 can potentially have a deeply negative carbon footprint.\\n\\nFinding 5: Among the pathways for Bio-H2 production, biomass gasification shows the lowest possible overall carbon footprint, while maintaining a reasonably low cost of $3–4/kg-H2 (see Figure 8). Although steam reforming of biogas is also a promising technology that is compatible with CCS technologies, biogas is widely used to produce biomethane, which has competitive uses such as directly substituting natural gas. As such, biogas is a valuable resource in and of itself and should be prioritized for its immediate applications over and above the production of Bio-H2.\\n\\nFinding 6: The technology to create Bio-H2 is relatively mature today, but major barriers still exist. Biomass gasification for Bio-H2 production has yet to overcome the problems of catalyst contamination/fouling, inconsistent feedstock quality, and the difficulty of separating H2 gas from other gases produced in the process.\\n\\nFinding 7: Bio-H2 with CCS can also be a solution for hard-to-abate sectors. Two examples are the iron and steel and the chemical production sectors. Due to their use of fossil fuel as a feedstock input, even the incorporation of green hydrogen has a limited influence on the carbon intensity of their processes. Using carbon-negative Bio-H2 can propel these sectors toward full net-zero or even a negative carbon footprint, with carbon-negative steel (−0.61 tCO2/t to 0.39 tCO2/t) and chemicals such as ammonia (−4.04 tCO2/t to −0.6 tCO2/t) and methanol (−3.89 tCO2/t to −0.17 tCO2/t).\\n\\nFinding 8: Bio-H2 with CCS provides flexibility in carbon management in different markets and geographies and enables circular carbon economies: This applies in regions where waste biomass resources are abundant and underutilized. The hydrogen produced from these resources can be used locally or converted into fuels and chemicals for shipping, and the CO2 captured as part of the process can be stored locally, shipped from a local production site, or shipped from a final production site. This flexibility creates opportunities to maximize local benefits while minimizing costs and carbon footprint depending on jurisdiction, natural resource mixes, and market configurations. In small communities where large amounts of local biomass wastes exist, Bio-H2 can be used to replace local fossil fuel consumption.\\n\\nFinding 9: In most markets, the cost of Bio-H2 today is generally higher than that of conventional hydrogen, and between that of blue and green hydrogen. To achieve $2/kg-H2, Bio-H2 production requires: 1) lower biomass feedstock costs (< $50/dry-ton); 2) lower CAPEX ($0.2–0.4/kg-H2); 3) other OPEX components to remain below 20–30 percent of the total cost; and 4) significant improvements in gasification technology, notably in feed systems and ash handling. These gains could be accomplished with a dedicated innovation program led by key countries and industries.\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nGlobal Biomass Resources Distribution\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAnisha, G.

       " 'A device that can harvest water from the air and provide hydrogen fuel—entirely powered by solar energy—has been a dream for researchers for decades. Now, EPFL chemical engineer Kevin Sivula and his team have made a significant step towards bringing this vision closer to reality. They have developed an ingenious yet simple system that combines semiconductor-based technology with novel electrodes that have two key characteristics: they are porous, to maximize contact with water in the air; and transparent, to maximize sunlight exposure of the semiconductor coating. When the device is simply exposed to sunlight, it takes water from the air and produces hydrogen gas. The results are published on 4 January 2023 in Advanced Materials.\\n\\nWhat’s new? It’s their novel gas diffusion electrodes, which are transparent, porous, and conductive, enabling this solar-powered technology for turning water – in its gas state from the air – into hydrogen fuel.\\n\\n“To realize a sustainable society, we need ways to store renewable energy as chemicals that can be used as fuels and feedstocks in industry. Solar energy is the most abundant form of renewable energy, and we are striving to develop economically-competitive ways to produce solar fuels,” says Sivula of EPFL’s Laboratory for Molecular Engineering of Optoelectronic Nanomaterials and principal investigator of the study.\\n\\nInspiration from a plant’s leaf\\n\\nIn their research for renewable fossil-free fuels, the EPFL engineers in collaboration with Toyota Motor Europe, took inspiration from the way plants are able to convert sunlight into chemical energy using carbon dioxide from the air. A plant essentially harvests carbon dioxide and water from its environment, and with the extra boost of energy from sunlight, can transform these molecules into sugars and starches, a process known as photosynthesis. The sunlight’s energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds inside of the sugars and starches.\\n\\nThe transparent gas diffusion electrodes developed by Sivula and his team, when coated with a light harvesting semiconductor material, indeed act like an artificial leaf, harvesting water from the air and sunlight to produce hydrogen gas. The sunlight’s energy is stored in the form of hydrogen bonds.\\n\\nInstead of building electrodes with traditional layers that are opaque to sunlight, their substrate is actually a 3-dimensional mesh of felted glass fibers.\\n\\nMarina Caretti, lead author of the work, says, “Developing our prototype device was challenging since transparent gas-diffusion electrodes have not been previously demonstrated, and we had to develop new procedures for each step. However, since each step is relatively simple and scalable, I think that our approach will open new horizons for a wide range of applications starting from gas diffusion substrates for solar-driven hydrogen production.”\\n\\nFrom liquid water to humidity in the air\\n\\nSivula and other research groups have previously shown that it is possible to perform artificial photosynthesis by generating hydrogen fuel from liquid water and sunlight using a device called a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. A PEC cell is generally known as a device that uses incident light to stimulate a photosensitive material, like a semiconductor, immersed in liquid solution to cause a chemical reaction. But for practical purposes, this process has its disadvantages e.g. it is complicated to make large-area PEC devices that use liquid.\\n\\nSivula wanted to show that the PEC technology can be adapted for harvesting humidity from the air instead, leading to the development of their new gas diffusion electrode. Electrochemical cells (e.g. fuel cells) have already been shown to work with gases instead of liquids, but the gas diffusion electrodes used previously are opaque and incompatible with the solar-powered PEC technology.\\n\\nNow, the researchers are focusing their efforts into optimizing the system. What is the ideal fiber size? The ideal pore size? The ideal semiconductors and membrane materials? These are questions that are being pursued in the EU Project “Sun-to-X”, which is dedicated to advance this technology, and develop new ways to convert hydrogen into liquid fuels.\\n\\nMaking transparent, gas-diffusion electrodes\\n\\nIn order to make transparent gas diffusion electrodes, the researchers start with a type of glass wool, which is essentially quartz (also known as silicon oxide) fibers and process it into felt wafers by fusing the fibers together at high temperature. Next, the wafer is coated with a transparent thin film of fluorine-doped tin oxide, known for its excellent conductivity, robustness and ease to scale-up. These first steps result in a transparent, porous, and conducting wafer, essential for maximizing contact with the water molecules in the air and letting photons through. The wafer is then coated again, this time with a thin-film of sunlight-absorbing semiconductor materials. This second thin coating still lets light through, but appears opaque due to the large surface area of the porous substrate. As is, this coated wafer can already produce hydrogen fuel once exposed to sunlight.\\n\\nThe scientists went on to build a small chamber containing the coated wafer, as well as a membrane for separating the produced hydrogen gas for measurement. When their chamber is exposed to sunlight under humid conditions, hydrogen gas is produced, achieving what the scientists set out to do, showing that the concept of a transparent gas- diffusion electrode for solar-powered hydrogen gas production can be achieved.\\n\\nWhile the scientists did not formally study the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in their demonstration, they acknowledge that it is modest for this prototype, and currently less than can be achieved in liquid-based PEC cells. Based on the materials used, the maximum theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the coated wafer is 12%, whereas liquid cells have been demonstrated up to 19% efficient.\\n\\nReference: “Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas-Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production” by Marina Caretti, Elizaveta Mensi, Raluca-Ana Kessler, Linda Lazouni, Benjamin Goldman, Loï Carbone, Simon Nussbaum, Rebekah A.

       " 'This change in mindset will be the result of high oil and gas prices pushing consumers toward alternative energy sources, he said, noting this is rendering government-led carbon pricing efforts obsolete. “Carbon markets are rubbish — they really don’t work. But the high incentive prices for carbon and oil is redirecting capital into the energy transition.”\\n\\nRead: Tips for DB plan sponsors as interest rates continue to rise\\n\\nLacey said institutional investors can take advantage of consumers growing interest in alternative energy by investing in energy sector businesses that are involved in fossil fuels and renewables. “The best way to get that value is actually investing directly in the conventional companies which are changing their business models.”\\n\\nWith oil prices pushed up by a number of geopolitical events, including the war in Ukraine, the short-term profits of petroleum producers have been high, he added, noting many of these companies were redirecting the higher profits into renewable energy. By turning their short-term profits towards producing renewable electricity, they expect to play a larger role in the energy markets of the future.\\n\\n“Obviously, we have to decarbonize electricity generation. The role played by renewables in electricity production must grow from about 20 per cent to 85 per cent between now and 2050. . . . There’s a pathway to get a very high percentage and that’s going to require a ridiculous amount of investment.”\\n\\nRead: What opportunities does the oil glut offer Canadian pension portfolios?\\n\\nImprovements in the infrastructure required to support renewable energy is another area some energy sector businesses are reinvesting short-term fossil fuel profits. “We need [electrical storage],” said Lacey. “We need to spend a ridiculous amount of money on transmission and distribution networks because there’s a huge amount of energy loss in a lot of these networks — up to 20 per cent in some U.S. states.”\\n\\nThe inefficiency of electrical transmission networks won’t ease over the next two decades, he added. “By the 2030s, . . . the only choice you’ll have is a factory electric vehicle. . . . But in the next 36 months, the oil price is going to stay very, very tight and, depending on what Russia does, you’re going to see a fetch of the oil price potentially spike further in 2023.”\\n\\nThe capital required to transition the global economy won’t just benefit investors in the energy sector. The construction of more efficient electrical networks, wind and solar facilities will also drive up the prices of the commodities needed to construct them. “[While we’re all] focused on the nickel used in batteries, there’s a huge amount of copper used, too. The two areas are outside my remit, but will be very, very tight over the next five to 10 years.”\\n\\nLacey also noted some transitional investments aren’t likely to emerge as particularly useful alternatives to fossil fuels. He likened investor interest in one area — hydrogen — to the famous tulip bubble craze that warped the Dutch stock market in the 17th century. “You have to be very, very careful with these companies because the leading companies will dominate them — and that’s where you can find value in hydrogen.”\\n\\nRead more coverage of the 2022 Investment Innovation Conference.',\n",

       " 'ANN ARBOR, MICH. – Most U.S. households that own a vehicle would save money on their transportation energy costs if they switched to electric vehicles, according to recent research.\\n\\nNew research from the University of Michigan shows more than 90% of households with a vehicle would see a drop in the percentage of their income spent on fueling that vehicle, if they choose EVs over those that burn gasoline. That’s in addition to reducing their carbon footprint.\\n\\nBut the study also showed more than half of the lowest-income Americans – an estimated 8.3 million U.S. households – would continue to have a high transportation energy burden. That means the household would spend more than 4% of its income on filling the gas tank or charging up an EV.\\n\\n“There’s overall a clear benefit for transition to EVs, both in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction, as well as lower percentage of your income spent on fueling. However, there’s a good portion of low-income households that although they see a reduction in their burden, it’s still high,” said Greg Keoleian, study senior author and director of U-M’s Center for Sustainable Systems.\\n\\nIn Michigan, the study showed that motorists could cut their transportation energy costs as much as in half.\\n\\n“The average car out there on the road in Michigan, when you compare it with a new battery electric vehicle, we’re going to see between 25% and 50% reduction in the in the cost of fueling,” Keoleian said.\\n\\nJoshua Newell, an urban geographer at U-M, said the study confirms the potential for widespread benefits from EV adoption but many vehicle owners are being left out of the benefits.\\n\\n“EV ownership in the U.S. has thus far been dominated by households with higher incomes and education levels, leaving the most vulnerable populations behind. Policy interventions are needed to increase EV accessibility so that all Americans can benefit from the EV transition,” Newell said.\\n\\nThe new study published today in Environmental Research Letters, an academic journal. It is the first study to consider both EV energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions across the geography of the country.\\n\\nOfficials said it’s also the first study to examine EV energy costs in terms of equity and distributive justice by calculating the EV energy burden for the entire United States. The study did not factor the purchase cost of EVs in the analysis.\\n\\nResearchers found that if cars, SUVs, and pickups across the country were replaced with new EVs, transportation energy burdens and greenhouse gas emissions would vary widely from place to place.\\n\\nBoth reductions in burden and emissions would be the strongest along the West Coast and in the Northeast because of lower electricity prices and energy grids powered by cleaner sources.\\n\\nEight percent of U.S. households would experience only a low savings with an EV for both transportation energy burden and carbon emissions. About half of those 9.6 million households are in the Midwest, including Michigan.\\n\\nThe most challenging EV transportation energy burden, from 10% to 64%, would remain for the lowest-income households and would mostly be found in the Midwest and the two states with the costliest electricity: Hawaii and Alaska.\\n\\nKeoleian said factors in calculating EV savings include cold winter temperatures that impact battery performance, electrical grids that largely depend on fossil fuel power generation, and electricity prices that are higher relative to gasoline prices.\\n\\nHe also said that as the nation’s grid continues to decarbonize and improvements are made to enhance EV charging accessibility, additional gains will be made in emissions reductions and lowered transportation energy burden.\\n\\nCurrently, EVs account for about 1% of cars, SUVs, and pickups on the road in the United States.\\n\\nMeanwhile, carbon emissions from transportation account for about 16% of the nation’s total – the largest source. Scientists consider electrification as the primary way to drop those emissions.\\n\\nCarbon emissions lead to global warming through the greenhouse effect, which drives the worsening climate crisis.\\n\\nRelated articles:\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions drop nearly two-thirds when motorists switch to EV pickups or SUVs\\n\\nMajor EV battery testing upgrade developed at University of Michigan\\n\\nConsumers Energy will add 200 vehicle charging stations across Michigan',\n",
       " \"The boardrooms of companies worldwide are wrestling with the net zero conundrum, with an increasing number announcing bold carbon reduction targets while lacking a detailed action plan to get there. In the scramble to develop strategies to meet these targets, new sustainability roles emerge within enterprises with diverse individuals and teams tasked with delivering on these wide-ranging ambitions. Whether a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) with a sizable team or a lone sustainability manager in the organisation, they are in for a challenging journey.\\n\\nThere is not anything else that touches all corners of an organisation more so than the carbon footprint. Of course, how a company runs its production drives its carbon emissions, but so do its procurement practices, its product designs, its logistics activities, its business travel and its investment decisions; even a company’s HR policies, which influence, among other things, employee commute patterns, can impact its total carbon footprint. This is not a simple task. It requires a complete organisational transformation that touches every corner of the business. It comprises four elements: a data policy, an energy transformation, a supply chain initiative and a product strategy.\\n\\nA Strategy for Transformation\\n\\nThe first barrier is that the targets are often wide-ranging and lack granularity; without mobilising many departments across the company, CSOs do not have the visibility or the necessary data to formulate a concrete net zero strategy. This frequently leads to a simplistic approach of cascading down the metrics to each level of the organisation, hoping every manager will reach their targets. But the newly assigned custodians often do not possess all the multi-faceted knowledge required of the topic or the tools available to take the actions.\\n\\nSome recent research from Squeaky, a clean energy marketplace for business, backed up this lack of knowledge. It surveyed 250 sustainability managers from FTSE 250, or equivalent-sized companies, to find out whether they were equipped with all the information they needed to be on course to reach net zero. The results showed that 27 percent of these managers admitted feeling out of depth in their roles. Given these figures, support is crucial. It is worrying that 26 percent of managers said they do not think their position is taken seriously enough by senior management, with 25 percent of respondents feeling they do not get enough support from their superiors.\\n\\nA net-zero data strategy\\n\\nThe reality is that within most organisations, there are silos: both organisational silos and data silos. For example, consider a company’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report. Very few in the organisation can explain where and how all the data behind the ESG metrics are collected and computed. That often makes the ESG report externally influential but internally powerless. There is no direct translation between the company’s ESG goals and their day-to-day decision-making for the people running the procurement, logistics, production and so on.\\n\\nThe role of the CSO is to transform the organisation; so that its people are empowered and educated to take bold actions to cut emissions; its data are connected to inform the opportunities and risks, and its operations and processes are shaped for a low-carbon business. To achieve these, the CSO must bring wide-ranging roles and functions together across the same table and start to build their commitment. The most natural way to start is to develop a common, data-driven understanding of the company’s carbon footprint distribution and its drivers across the operations.\\n\\nWhen it comes to sustainability data, ask the questions of what, where, who, and how. First, what data types are required to make the net zero transition decisions? This often starts with building an emission inventory – a list of essential emission sources for the company, such as energy and fuel consumption, transport, or waste disposal.\\n\\nWhere does the data reside? Are they in ERP systems or distributed across different documents and files? It is not surprising for a large organisation to find its sustainability data across many systems. Who is responsible for generating and maintaining that data? And if additional data collection or transformation is required, who would be accountable for doing it? How will the company collect, centralise, and maintain its sustainability data going forward?\\n\\nNet Zero is not a digital transformation but can be accelerated by it. Rather than looking at niche solutions, the strategy needs to look vertically and horizontally across an organisation, or as some people prefer, up and down and left and right. Achieving this is not a digital transformation and does not require innovative technology but a new way of thinking that will require a business transformation.\\n\\nAn energy transition strategy\\n\\nCompanies have pursued energy efficiency and process optimisation efforts for decades. These efforts continue to be essential but far from enough. Suppose you have a five percent energy reduction goal. In that case, you can probably spread it across every facility manager and ask them to become more efficient with their electrical use and be done. But if you plan to reach Net Zero, you must take non-incremental strategies.\\n\\nOne of the crucial decisions is whether to buy energy or generate your own. The option to purchase a carbon offset or renewable energy certificate may seem like a quick win. Still, it involves capital spending to replace the cost of developing your renewable resource. This may seem attractive, but this cost will increase over time as the demand for these devices will grow faster than the supply.\\n\\nThis is the first important decision. Secondly, if you purchase electricity which route to take there? Is it best for your organization to buy on an annual basis or opt for a power purchase agreement (PPA) to lock in the price ahead of time? The important thing is that the strategy must look at long-term solutions as opposed to a quick fix because the market dynamics of these energy certificates in terms of cost and supply will change as the pressure of climate compliance increases.\\n\\nAnother essential concept is electrification. The objective is to use the same amount of energy as usual but from electricity instead of fossil fuels. Provided that electricity comes from renewable sources, then CO2 emissions are reduced. Electrification falls into a similar category to fuel switching, whereby you shift fuels to a cleaner source. For example, if you use coal, you can switch to natural gas, or if you use natural gas, you may consider electricity. Once you switch to electricity, you can use cleaner and greener sources of electricity or if that is not available, look to power purchase agreements.\\n\\nWorking with the supply chain\\n\\nThe supply chain is an essential factor when it comes to achieving net zero. Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups or scopes by the most widely used international accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain.\\n\\nAccording to the Carbon Trust, up to 90 percent of an organisation’s environmental impact lies in the value chain - either upstream (supply chain) or downstream (product use phase). Therefore, analysing and acting on your value chain is a vital step for any business that wants to become more sustainable and prepare for a low-carbon economy.\\n\\nThe supply chain represents a significant part of the carbon, so it is very important, but at the same time, they carry much complexity. Supply chains often lack transparency and represent probably one of the biggest challenges in quantifying and reducing carbon footprint. However, companies that can mobilise and engage their suppliers and help them reduce their carbon footprint can have a substantial competitive advantage in sourcing responsible and low carbon footprint products.\\n\\nCompanies are just starting to find ways to engage and reach their suppliers and acquire carbon-related data from their suppliers. Still, this process needs to evolve rapidly to meet the sustainable targets that many organisations are setting.\\n\\nAn eco-friendly product strategy based on data\\n\\nThe product portfolio is the other big area that will form part of a net-zero strategy. For example, the automotive sector has a strategy to make cleaner, fuel-efficient, hybrid or electric vehicles. Any decision made here will affect their downstream scope three emissions. At the same time, the company can consider redesigning its products to use more eco-friendly materials or even use less material.\\n\\nIn the past, they may have put performance or some other criteria at the top of their requirements list. However, they do not know how much water or electricity is needed to meet these goals or how much mining metals work is required, which can dramatically affect the finished product’s carbon footprint. There is also the option of changing the supplier mix to ensure that the supply chain is as environmentally friendly as possible. Automotive OEMs have never paid attention to suppliers’ environmental performance; they all make the same components, so purchasing decisions were generally based on price, quality, and delivery. Turning that around and adding the product’s carbon footprint into the mix requires a whole new level of data granularity for them to decide and select the optimum supplier.\\n\\nAnother example of product-use related carbon emissions is the metered dose inhalers. What if medical devices that have been developed to treat the health effects of climate change are themselves contributing to the crisis?\\n\\nThat is the quandary that pharmaceutical companies have been facing with inhalers that are used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Research from the United Kingdom estimates that inhalers account for three to four percent of its national health system’s carbon emissions. UK pharmaceutical giant GSK have said that inhalers are responsible for 45 percent of its carbon footprint.\\n\\nThis situation has led to increasing efforts across Europe to reduce the environmental impact of these inhalers. It is much the same tale in the United States where in 2020 Americans used approximately 144 million metered-dose inhalers, which equates to the greenhouse gas emissions of half a million cars for a year.\\n\\nThese challenges may require companies to make structural or cultural changes to their business. Therefore, organisations should look at net zero as an opportunity to transform themselves into a more innovative, efficient, and adaptive business.\\n\\nHow to get started\\n\\nIt may seem a daunting challenge to those new to sustainability, but there are some general guidelines that all organisations can follow. The common place to start will be to gain a baseline understanding of not just the organisation’s total carbon footprint but the distribution of that carbon footprint across different pockets in the company and how they relate to the operations.\\n\\nThere are two types of distribution to consider. One is the distribution across the company's value chain and processes. Is this more around production and transport, or is it more around the supply chain? So, where does most carbon footprint lie? The second is a distribution across different geographic facilities. Are there significant facilities that the company can focus on? If so, that would be one common place to gain that baseline understanding.\\n\\nRegarding where to start on carbon reductions, that will vary from industry to industry. A large percentage of your carbon footprint will come from energy consumption if you operate in the metals sector. That means these companies should focus on an energy transition. But if you are a company that is close to the consumer and the ecosystem, such as fast-food companies, much of your carbon footprint will be in your value chain. In this instance, focusing on a supply chain strategy makes sense. That is an assessment a company can only make once they have a baseline understanding of their carbon footprint.\\n\\nWherever you decide to start, it is essential to get started, and backed by the visibility and transparency your data strategy can deliver; you will be able to monitor, assess and report on your progress towards a net zero future.\",\n",

       " 'Lützerath, Germany – Today, thousands of concerned citizens from diverse countries, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, have travelled to the small German village of Lützerath in solidarity with climate activists who are currently trying to stop this area being demolished to access the coal in the ground underneath it. Activists who have been occupying this village for two years to prevent its destruction are now in the process of being evicted. German multinational fossil fuel company RWE has bought the area in order to expand its lignite coal mine, Garzweiler, one of the biggest carbon bombs in Europe.\\n\\nKarsten Smid, energy expert for Greenpeace Germany, said: “Today in Lützerath, people are rising together for a better future, and are showing massive support for the activists who have been protesting against coal mining for years. Lützerath is the limit: if the coal underneath is dug out, Germany won’t be able to respect the Paris agreement. RWE’s greed cannot stand higher than protection of people and climate. It is time to stop the destruction of Lützerath. This coal has to stay in the ground.”\\n\\nSara Ayech, Global Campaign Lead for Climate at Greenpeace International, added: “We’re in 2023, in the middle of a climate crisis, and while destroying a village to expand one of the biggest carbon bombs in Europe should be considered criminal, it is still legal. Fossil fuel companies’ influence is so powerful that the ones considered criminals now are the ones fighting for climate justice. It is time to hold fossil fuel companies accountable.”\\n\\nUnderneath the small village of Lützerath lies lignite coal, the most climate-damaging energy source and the Rhenish lignite mining area is the largest source of CO2 in Europe. But driven by its greed and despite the climate crisis, the fossil fuel company RWE plans to destroy the village in order to expand its Garzweiler mine and extract the coal.\\n\\nThis project, just as fossil fuel extraction and new infrastructures everywhere, is linked to the destruction of people’s lives, of the climate and of the planet. And in the end, this is having the worst impact on people in countries which have contributed the least to the climate crisis.\\n\\nThis coal is the opposite of what’s needed to answer the climate, energy and cost of living crisis. Building renewables together with energy saving measures is cheaper, quicker and will bring energy security. It is time to accelerate a just transition towards affordable, clean, renewable energy in a way that benefits communities, workers and the climate, and to end new fossil fuel infrastructures.\\n\\nHundreds of activists have been resisting fossil fuel destruction and occupying what remains of the Lützerath village for more than two years. They have built tree houses, huts and solar plants, revitalised the village and shown us all that a society built on climate-justice and solidarity is possible.\\n\\nWhat’s at stake here is not only Germany not respecting the Paris Agreement, but also fossil fuel companies destroying our future for short-term profit. Lützerath is a vivid example of the crimes fossil fuel companies are committing everywhere on the planet. Fossil fuel companies have been polluting and destroying people’s lives since the very beginning of their existence. And they have been getting away with it for too long.

Here, they share their thoughts and reflections on the path ASEAN can take to decarbonisation.\\n\\nWe are in the midst of an energy crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen since the 1970s.\\n\\nThe decisions leaders make now about decarbonisation determine our collective future.\\n\\nGet it right, and short-term upheaval transforms into long-term sustainability.\\n\\nGet it wrong, and we will struggle to meet our environmental targets – specifically the Paris Agreement target of global carbon emissions reaching net zero by 2050 – casting further doubt over the future of our planet.\\n\\nASEAN\\'s energy crisis\\n\\nASEAN, South East Asia’s regional trading and political bloc, is vitally important to this outlook, potentially being the deciding factor in the future we ultimately face.\\n\\nASEAN is the world’s fourth-largest energy consumer. Its current energy makeup is skewed towards traditional forms of power generation, with fossil fuels making up 83 per cent of its energy mix, and energy demand is expected to increase.\\n\\nThe energy crisis has therefore disproportionately affected the bloc, exposing ASEAN member countries to increasing economic, energy security and geopolitical risks.\\n\\nThe huge conundrum that the bloc’s leaders now face is how to secure energy supplies to develop the region’s economies while also decarbonising them.\\n\\nThe good news is that many of its member states show a strong commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. Of the bloc’s 10 member states, only the Philippines has not yet committed to net zero by 2050, while Indonesia has set a target of 2060.\\n\\nAll forecasts – and just the sheer practicalities of such a large transition – suggest achieving net zero won’t be easy.\\n\\nThere is no one solution, and each country will have to pursue its own policies, depending on their respective priorities.\\n\\nCapitalising on renewable energy sources\\n\\nA major shift away from the emissions produced by coal power generation sits at the center of change, the step change in efficiency, and the deployment of low carbon technologies can complement the transition.\\n\\nThe policy environment increasingly favours low-carbon energy, and ASEAN’s share of renewable energy increased to 14 per cent of the energy mix in 2020, continuing to rise even during the pandemic.\\n\\nGreen energy resources have been steadily climbing.\\n\\nFor example, Vietnam’s success in the global solar market shows what’s possible when political will, sectoral reform and market incentives come together.\\n\\nLaos, the self-declared \"battery of Asia\", applies hydropower, while Indonesia and the Philippines sit on almost one-quarter of the world’s geothermal generation capacity.\\n\\nASEAN is also rich in the raw materials required for clean energy products. These include bauxite, nickel, tin and rare earth elements, which can variously be found throughout the region, particularly Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand.\\n\\nIn addition, Malaysia and Vietnam are among the world’s largest solar module makers.\\n\\nCreating a climate for investors\\n\\nTo capitalise on these and other advantages, ASEAN’s leaders will have to show an unwavering commitment to supporting and funding the green agenda.\\n\\nInvestors will be looking for energy sector reform, including the dismantling of fossil fuel subsidies, and a hospitable investment and regulatory climate.\\n\\nThis is important because international support and external investment will reduce some of the financial burden and risk that come with developing and scaling up new technologies.\\n\\nThis is emerging, as evidenced by the tie-ups countries are making with those ASEAN states that are piloting green hydrogen systems for power provision.\\n\\nAs the recent COP27 meeting underlined, those nations that have the means to invest in and support emerging economies in their policies to accelerate the energy transition, should do so.\\n\\nNew energy strategy required\\n\\nEquity and justice are becoming interwoven into climate action, along with the help to develop and implement clean energy policy and mobilise finance for clean energy schemes.\\n\\nReflecting the global need to collaborate in the effort to reach net zero, the World Economic Forum is supporting ASEAN’s energy transition through multiple initiatives.\\n\\nAmong these are country-level work in Indonesia to mobilise finance for clean energy in partnership with the country’s Chamber of Commerce; supporting the development and implementation of Malaysia’s National Energy Policy through a series of roundtables held with the government and private-sector energy companies; and supporting the forthcoming ASEAN Energy Leaders for Just Energy Transition community.\\n\\nThe latter is aimed at strengthening intra-regional and international cooperation to help accelerate a just energy transition.\\n\\nOut of the 1973 oil shock emerged an energy strategy that relied less on oil, improved energy efficiency and sought a more diversified energy mix.\\n\\nOut of the current energy crisis, a new energy strategy is required, one that decarbonises economies worldwide.\\n\\nIf ASEAN can achieve this, its countries will enjoy safe, equitable energy systems that support their long-term growth, and we will all be a lot closer to realising the Paris Agreement’s goals.\\n\\nTop photo from ASEAN / FB and Pexels',\n",
       " 'Employee satisfaction is a big motivator for companies to go green, particularly as the U.K. faces its tightest labor market in decades. Hiroshi Watanabe / Getty Images\\n\\nLONDON — A fifth of the world\\'s biggest companies have committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions, according to analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, and a large portion of those emissions come from the workplace. Demand for sustainable offices is high, which means prices are, too. In fact, there is now a 26% gap in sale prices between London buildings with sustainability ratings from organizations such as BREEAM and LEED and those without, according to data from analytics company MSCI. That\\'s known as the \"green premium.\" On the flip side, less environmentally friendly, typically older, buildings come with a \"brown discount.\" That seems to leave company bosses and investors with a simple choice between lower overheads and lower emissions — but there\\'s more to the story. Joy Nazzari is a founding director based in London. She\\'s looking to grow her business but her former warehouse office building is too small and inaccessible for people with disabilities, so it\\'s \"mission critical\" that the team relocates. \"Cost is an incredible barrier,\" Nazzari told CNBC, adding that an increase in office size and better green credentials would cause rent to go up by \"at least 50%\" from what she\\'s seen on the market so far. \"When we\\'re looking at buildings with this brown discount it\\'s hard to not go for a building like ours which is a cute old warehouse,\" she said.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nEven finding sustainable spaces can be a challenge. \"It\\'s not like you\\'re stumbling over these green buildings all over the place. They\\'re rare,\" she said, estimating that fewer than a third of the buildings she\\'d seen would fit the bill. That scarcity drives prices up even further. On top of that, there\\'s company branding to think about. \"In light of the planet burning this might not seem as relevant [but] your office building is a huge reflection of your business\\' brand. A lot of new buildings are very office-y and corporate and perhaps not somewhere that we would traditionally choose,\" she said. But Nazzari is facing a lot of pressure to move, particularly from her own employees. \"Our team is really young, and the generation is very alive to the earth they\\'re inheriting … They\\'re extremely aware of the green agenda, and they bring it up all the time. It\\'s a pressure we feel coming up from our team,\" she said. Even with the increased costs, the majority of companies are willing to invest in a green working space, according to the global JLL Future of Work Survey 2022. The research found that 74% of the companies surveyed, represented by 1,095 senior corporate real estate decision makers across 13 countries, \"are likely to pay a premium for green credentials,\" with 56% planning to do so by 2025.\\n\\nBig motivator\\n\\nEmployee satisfaction is a big motivator for companies to go green, particularly as the U.K. faces its tightest labor market in decades. The unemployment rate was 3.5% in October, the lowest it\\'s been since 1974, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. This then rose to 3.7% in December. \"We have a critical shortage of skills and labour that is damaging firms and holding back growth,\" Jane Gratton, head of people policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said in a press release in November. Understandably, businesses are eager to retain the staff they\\'ve got.\\n\\n\"We are all aware that we\\'re in an environment of nearly full employment and there\\'s a real need to build an environment in which their staff are working is one that is appealing,\" Peter Crowther, junior vice president at the British Council for Offices, told CNBC. \"New employees are more inquisitive as to the performance from an environmental perspective about the building their employer occupies,\" he said. Almost 80% of organizations surveyed in the JLL report said their employees \"will increasingly expect the workplace to have a positive impact on the environment\" while 75% said the same about a positive impact on society. And the shift to hybrid working means that every day, employees think about whether there is value in going into the office, according to the CEO of Edge, a sustainable real estate developer. \"We\\'ve seen so many examples of offices that are such low quality that people don\\'t want to go into the office any more,\" Coen van Oostrom said, adding that the lack of contact can cause a company\\'s culture to deteriorate. \"What is really expensive is if you have a big office building that\\'s used one or two days a week. That\\'s a lot of rent you\\'re paying for limited face-to-face time,\" van Oostrom said.\\n\\nTighter financial conditions\\n\\nwatch now',\n",

       " 'LONDON: The European Central Bank could radically cut the carbon footprint of its corporate bond portfolio by selling just 50 billion euros ($54.30 billion) of polluting companies\\' debt, research shows, but analysts say this would risk big market distortions.The ECB \\'s green ambitions are in the spotlight after board member Isabel Schnabel this week said the bank must step up efforts to become more climate friendly.But other central bank policymakers, including from the ECB and U.S. Federal Reserve, have said tackling climate change is for governments not central bankers.And analysts fear such action by the ECB could go against central banks\\' mission of maintaining market stability.Schnabel, head of the ECB\\'s market operations, said the ECB was meant to tilt its corporate bond holdings towards greener assets via new purchases but new bond buys have been stopped and reinvestment will soon be wound down as part of its inflation fight.Schnabel said the ECB needed now to consider a reshuffling of its 345-billion-euro corporate bond portfolio towards greener issuers.She faced immediate pushback from ECB policymaker Pierre Wunsch, who said it was for governments to fight climate change. But her comments got market watchers running the numbers.Analysis from sustainable finance think tank Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII) showed the ECB could cut the carbon footprint associated with its corporate bond holdings by 87% if it sold just 48.3 billion euros of debt from the 25 top polluters.These included oil and gas companies such as Shell , TotalEnergies, Repsol and BP.\"This is an extremely high concentration of carbon in a few names,\" said AFII founder Ulf Erlandsson , adding the total emissions they account for is substantial in the context of annual global CO2 emissions of around 30-40 giga tonnes.Financial institutions worldwide are looking to reduce the climate-damaging greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by the companies they lend to, as part of efforts to cap global warming, yet central banks have been more cautious.U.S. Fed chair Jerome Powell has said the bank\\'s regulatory powers give it a narrow role to ensure financial institutions \"appropriately manage\" the risks they face from climate change. \"We are not, and will not be, a \\'climate policymaker\\'\", he said.But ECB President Christine Lagarde has made greening monetary policy one of her objectives. The Bank of England set out plans to \"green\" its corporate bond portfolio in 2021 but these were soon overtaken by a decision to unwind all holdings as part of its fight against inflation.HURDLESWhile calculating the carbon footprint of the ECB\\'s portfolio is challenging, AFII estimates it to be around 438 million tonnes of CO2 annually - more than Italy or France emitted in 2017, based on European Union data.The ECB does not disclose how much it owns of any individual bond so AFII\\'s estimate is based on the assumption that it holds an average of 27% of each of the outstanding bond of Corporate Sector Purchase Programme- eligible issuers.Some analysts say that any ECB selling of so-called \"brown bonds\" -- those issued by highly polluting companies in sectors like utilities and energy -- would distort the market. Sylvain Broyer , chief economist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at S&P Global Ratings, said it would lead to \"massive repricing\" of corporate debt and go against the ECB\\'s focus of maintaining market stability.Another objection is that selling the bonds would penalise high-emitting companies that are looking to become more environmentally friendly and need financial backing to do so.The ECB is already addressing that problem by giving companies climate scores that are based not just on their current performance but also on their goals and climate disclosures.The ECB uses those scores to steer its bond purchases towards greener issuers.Larissa de Barros Fritz, fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, estimated any move by the ECB to sell brown to buy green bonds could mean spread widening of 7-15 basis points for bonds that the ECB would no longer buy.For Trisha Taneja , global head of ESG for the origination and advisory division at Deutsche Bank , excluding the most polluting companies altogether would also make the ECB\\'s portfolio too unbalanced.\" is why... the approach should be in a tilt towards credible transition strategy, rather than towards current climate performance,\" she said.',\n",

       " 'Spending on low-carbon projects will increase by $60 billion this year, 10% higher than 2022, led by wind developments but helped by a significant rise in funding for hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) infrastructure, Rystad Energy research shows. The growth in total spending is a slowdown from recent years – which averaged 20% annual increases – as cost-conscious developers tighten their purse strings after two years of soaring prices.\\n\\nInvestments in green sectors surged 21% in 2022 to overtake related oil and gas spending for the first time, but inflation-spooked developers seem set to rein in spending growth this year. However, as inflationary pressure weakens, we expect spending to rebound.\\n\\nInvestments in the geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), hydrogen, hydropower, offshore and onshore wind, nuclear and solar industries are set to hit $620 billion in 2023, up from about $560 billion last year. Service segments included in our calculations include project equipment and materials, engineering and construction, wells, operations and maintenance, and logistics and vessels.\\n\\nSolar and onshore wind will contribute the most by a sizable margin. Spending on solar investments will total $250 billion this year, rising only 6% over 2022. However, thanks to the falling cost of polysilicon, the primary cost driver of solar PV cells, capacity growth will be more substantial than dollar investments suggest. Despite a relatively insignificant rise in investment value, installed capacity is expected to swell by roughly 25% to 1,250 gigawatts (GW).\\n\\nSpending growth will vary widely across industries. Hydrogen and CCUS are expected to see the most significant annual increase, growing 149% and 136%, respectively. Total hydrogen spending will approach $7.8 billion in 2023, while CCUS investments will total about $7.4 billion.\\n\\nIn contrast, the hydropower market is expected to shrink over 2022, while nuclear investments are forecast to stay relatively flat. Onshore wind investments are projected to increase by 12% to about $230 billion, while offshore wind spending is expected to jump 20% to $48 billion. Expenditure in geothermal is expected to jump significantly – about 45% – albeit from a relatively low starting position.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nRelated: Platts Survey: OPEC+ Oil Production Rose By 140,000 Bpd In December\\n\\n\\n\\n“The weaker-than-expected growth is not a reason to panic for those in the low-carbon sector. Rampant inflation typically triggers fiscal restraint across industries, and spending will likely bounce back in the coming years. The outlook for hydrogen and CCUS is especially rosy as technology advances, and the large-scale feasibility of these solutions improves,” says Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research with Rystad Energy.\\n\\nLow-carbon investments are more short-cycled than the fossil fuel industries and are, therefore, more sensitive to inflationary pressures. Project plans, permitting activity and awards from companies and governments indicate this year’s expected investment growth. Based on likely activity, investments for each project were calculated based on specific characteristics and where we forecast unit prices across 2023.\\n\\nWhat sectors will benefit the most?\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nLooking at the individual segment types, operations and maintenance companies will achieve the most growth this year – 16%. These companies are more exposed to the overall installed operational capacity, which will grow this year at a similar pace to 2022, with last year’s additions entering their first full year of operations. These providers’ costs are also more labor-driven than other sectors, and high consumer inflation is likely to push up wages for skilled labor, inflating segment spending.\\n\\nLogistics and vessel companies, heavily weighted towards offshore projects and marine trade, are estimated to take in 15% more this year. Spending in the equipment, materials, engineering, and construction sectors, where the bulk of global investment dollars are spent, are expected to rise by about 9% annually. The new and relatively tiny market of suppliers exposed to low-carbon, well-related services is forecast to climb 33% this year, driven by geothermal drilling and CO2 injection. Despite the significant increase, investments in this market will only total about $3.7 billion.\\n\\nRegional considerations\\n\\nSome suppliers are not targeting the global market, preferring to focus on regional clients and project hubs. The location of confirmed projects this year shows that Africa is set to attract the highest investment growth with a 26% increase, mainly driven by onshore wind projects in Egypt. Australia takes second place with 23% growth with expansion across almost all sectors.\\n\\nAsian growth of 12% is heavily impacted by China’s ambitions within solar and wind, while the US Inflation Reduction Act and a step-up in renewables and CCUS will help push North American investments up 9% this year. Europe is challenged by high inflation and a regional supply chain in crisis, resulting in a projected investment growth of 7% – much lower than the tempo needed to meet the European Union’s REPowerEU ambitions.\\n\\nBy Rystad Energy\\n\\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:',\n",

The IEA estimated that the global market for manufacturing of clean-energy components could be worth as much as $650 billion by the end of the decade. That\\'s three times as much as current levels and if all of the investment proposals for low-carbon energy progress to development, the global economy would be two-thirds of the way to net-zero emissions. Advertisement\\n\\nFatih Birol, the head of the Paris-based energy agency, said there\\'s been a steady call for reconfiguring the global energy sector to accommodate more renewables and low-carbon alternatives. The issue now is a \"central pillar\" of the economic strategies of global policymakers.\\n\\n\"The current momentum is moving us closer to meeting our international energy and climate goals - and there is almost certainly more to come,\" he said.\\n\\nRELATED Norway to expand offshore carbon capture and storage footprint\\n\\nThe latest data from the U.S. economy, the world\\'s largest, show the share of natural gas in electric power generation will be around 38% this year, 1% lower than last year, coal-fired power declines 2% to 18% and renewables increase from 21% in 2022 to 24% this year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor Birol, however, that shows that progress is lopsided and the global economy needs to do more to find alternatives and more variety to avoid an over-dependent relationship, such as the pre-war energy ties between Russian and the European Union.\\n\\n\"I\\'m pleased to see many economies around the world competing today to be leaders in the new energy economy and drive an expansion of clean technology manufacturing in the race to net zero,\" he said. \"It\\'s important, though, that this competition is fair -- and that there is a healthy degree of international collaboration, since no country is an energy island and energy transitions will be more costly and slow if countries do not work together.\"\\n\\nSupporting equity in the global energy sector was one of the themes from the COP27 environment summit in Egypt last year. Many of the leaders of the world\\'s largest economies voiced support last year for assisting developing nations that have been significantly and disproportionately affected by climate change.\\n\\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, North American leaders gathered to say the region could be a clean energy leader.\\n\\n\"We should be the clean energy powerhouse of the world,\" President Joe Biden said. \"And that\\'s not hyperbole.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement',\n",

Image Courtesy of Kingspan\\n\\nA 2022 United Nations report claims that the negative impacts of the climate crisis are mounting much faster than scientists predicted less than a decade ago. Rising greenhouse-gas emissions could soon outstrip the ability of many communities to adapt, and the consequences will continue to hit the world’s most vulnerable populations. As climate scientist Maarten van Aalst suggests, “Any further delay in global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” The data is clear: to protect our planet, we need to prevent a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures this century. To do so, the world must achieve a 45% reduction in global carbon emissions from 2010 levels to 2030, to then reach a net-zero state by 2050. It is evident, however, that we are on track to miss this goal by a substantial amount. The clock is ticking, and every industry should act fast (and drastically) to even dream of greener cities.\\n\\nAlthough it must be a universal effort, this especially applies to industries like the construction sector, which globally accounts for 35% of energy consumption, 38% of energy-related carbon emissions and 50% of resource consumption. Current efforts are clearly not enough to revert this situation, but the good news is that more and more companies in the field are increasingly working to be part of the solution. Some are responding with urgency by tracking and reducing carbon emissions as close to zero as possible, seeking to transition to a low-carbon economy and mitigate the effects of climate change in the process.\\n\\nSave this picture! Catalyst Building / Michael Green Architecture. Image © Benjamin Benschneider\\n\\nReducing carbon emissions from multiple scopes\\n\\nAs Kingspan explains, going net zero requires companies to track and reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, all part of a global standardized framework set by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 GHG emissions come from sources that are directly controlled or owned by an organization, such as boilers, furnaces and manufacturing processes. Indirect in nature, Scope 2 is associated with a company’s electricity consumption, including emissions that generate from the heating, cooling and lighting of buildings (or electric fleet power). Scope 3 emissions, also known as value chain emissions, account for up to 90% of an organization’s total carbon footprint and are thus harder to measure and manage. They encompass 15 different categories, among them investments, transportation and distribution.\\n\\nSave this picture! Kingspan Planet Passionate. Image Courtesy of Kingspan\\n\\nUnder a proposed rule introduced by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), tracking and reporting these emissions might soon become a requirement for public companies. Kingspan –manufacturer of high-performance insulation and building envelope solutions– is one of the companies from the architecture and construction world that has signed on. In 2021, Kingspan committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% by 2030 (from a 2020 base year). In addition, Kingspan has committed to a 42% absolute reduction in Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, use of sold products, and end of life treatment of sold products by 2030 (from a 2020 base year). These climate goals are part of its 10-year Planet Passionate sustainability initiative, which aims to decrease the group’s carbon emissions in manufacturing and business operations. The strategy consists of implementing a series of measures and targets that promote environmental health in all stages, ranging from using renewable energy and reducing CO2 emissions from suppliers, to using recycled materials in their products.\\n\\nPioneering solutions for sustainable building envelopes\\n\\nReducing emissions from multiple scopes, Kingspan reports that, so far, it is on track to meet its net zero carbon manufacturing goal. But the group’s initiatives go beyond fabrication processes and electricity use; they also translate into a wide range of solutions and products that contribute to low-carbon buildings. Their insulated metal wall panels are a prime example. Combining technology with aesthetic flexibility, these advanced building envelope solutions contribute to energy efficiency in many types of buildings.\\n\\nSave this picture!

To keep costs down, design professionals opted for different panel thicknesses and flat panels to cover the sweeping façade. And to achieve the desired aesthetic, these were produced in a unique color combination. Mandeville High School, for its part, is another successful case that used the Designwall 2000 insulated panels to remain energy-efficient and, at the same time, create a colorful, bold look with dynamic patterns –ideal for an educational institution.\\n\\nSave this picture!

Granting architects the freedom to attach a specific facade, the all-in-one alternative serves as an air and vapor barrier for the entire building, eliminating thermal-bridging energy losses associated with standard stud/cavity insulation construction. Energy efficiency plays a key role in the building’s sustainability mission; so much so that it incorporates a telemetry system that reports monthly energy usage. Kingspan’s insulated panels thus became an attractive choice for their performance and ability to blend with a sleek, contemporary design. Similarly, the Catalyst Building utilizes 35,000 square feet of KarrierPanel insulated metal panels –that can be reused and recycled– to create an envelope with maximum thermal efficiency. The solution, coupled with a cross-laminated timber structure, plays a vital role in the project’s low-carbon approach.\\n\\nSave this picture! CODE Building / Wolf Ackerman, EskewDumezRipple.

Therefore, companies participating in the construction industry have the responsibility to question their impact, adopt bold initiatives, consume resources efficiently, reduce their waste, and develop smart technologies and products. Simply put, their priorities must shift accordingly in order to truly make an impact.\\n\\nTo explore more of Kingspan’s sustainable solutions, visit their website or browse our product catalog.',\n",

In line with this, the firm’s targeted net production for 2023 is 650 million to 660 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), of which, production from China and overseas accounts for approximately 70 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Chinese giant’s net production is expected to reach 690 million to 700 million BOE in 2024 and 730 million to 740 million BOE in 2025. The total capital expenditure for 2023 is budgeted at RMB 100 billion ($14.8 billion) to RMB 110 billion ($16.3 billion), of which, capital expenditures for exploration, development, production and others will account for approximately 18 per cent, 59 per cent, 21 per cent and 2 per cent of the total capital expenditure, respectively.\\n\\nZhou Xinhuai, CEO of CNOOC, remarked: “In the coming year, CNOOC Limited will continue to seek progress while delivering stable performance. The company will vigorously implement the three major programs of reserves & production augmentation, independent technological innovation and green energy transition, and press ahead with the initiative of quality and efficiency dual upgrading, so that we can sharpen our edge of core competitiveness and create greater value for shareholders.”\\n\\nCNOOC highlighted that nine new projects are expected to come on stream during 2023, including projects in China – Bozhong 19-6 condensate gas field Phase I development project, Lufeng 12-3 oilfield development project and Enping 18-6 oilfield development project – and overseas projects such as Payara project in Guyana, Buzios 5 project and Mero 2 project in Brazil.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Chinese player continues to promote green and low-carbon developments to expand its new energy business. To this end, the firm plans to steadily advance the project of onshore power for offshore platforms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production activities. In addition, CNOOC will lead the development of the CZ7 centralized offshore wind power demonstration project in Hainan, which, upon completion, can provide clean electricity of about 500 million kWh per year to the grid, reducing CO 2 emission by about 2.64 million tons each year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, CNOOC underlined that it “always attaches importance to rewarding shareholders and actively shares the benefits of development.” Therefore, the expected annual payout ratio of the company from 2022 to 2024 will be no less than 40 per cent and the annual absolute dividend is expected to be no less than HK$ 0.70/share (tax inclusive). This is subject to the approval by the general meeting of shareholders on the proposed dividends for each year.\\n\\nRegarding CNOOC’s recent activities, it is worth noting that the Chinese giant kicked off operations in December 2022 at its oilfields’ onshore power project to supply electricity to 39 offshore production platforms.\\n\\nRelated Article Posted: 20 days ago China’s oil and gas firm inaugurates power-from-shore project Posted: 20 days ago\\n\\nAdditionally, the firm inked the Integrated Natural Gas Processing System (SIP) contract with Petrobras in the same month.',\n",

       " 'NETL-funded research on an approach to recycle hydraulic fracturing water using natural filtration and biogenic activity in specific layers of rock is attracting international attention with a “highly commended” recognition in a global competition sponsored by an acclaimed engineering organization.\\n\\nThe University of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center’s Produced Water Management Through Geologic Homogenization, Conditioning, and Reuse (GHCR) project, developed in partnership with the North Dakota Industrial Commission Oil and Gas Research Program) and Nuverra Environmental Solutions, was a finalist in the Oil and Gas category of the 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) Global Awards.\\n\\nThe project was funded by NETL and the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.\\n\\nWhile first place in the competition went to University College London, United Kingdom, for its methane to valuable chemicals research effort, the GHCR research received a “highly commended” designation.\\n\\nFounded in 1922, UK-based IChemE is the internationally recognized learned society for chemical, biochemical and process engineers. The organization advances chemical engineering’s contribution for the benefit of society.\\n\\nWhen hydrocarbons are recovered from oil and gas formations through hydraulic fracturing, significant quantities of high-salinity water are often co-produced. This water is generally referred to as “produced water.”\\n\\nAccording to a study by Duke University, “energy companies used nearly 250 billion gallons of water to extract unconventional shale gas and oil from hydraulically fractured wells in the United States between 2005 and 2014…During the same period, the fracked wells generated about 210 billion gallons of wastewater.”\\n\\nThe GHCR concept offers a novel approach to recycling produced water from oil and gas extraction, particularly in the Bakken region of North Dakota. With energy industries’ demand for water expected to double in the coming years, careful management of water is essential to ensuring that local communities have adequate clean water supplies.\\n\\nNETL’s Joseph Renk, who served as the project officer on the research effort, said that in the GHCR process, produced water is reinjected into the subsurface where it takes advantage of the natural filtration and biogenic activity of geological strata to remove contaminants including suspended solids and organics.\\n\\n“Lab testing and field samples indicated that North Dakota Inyan Kara sandstone and native formation fluids are able to treat, stabilize and homogenize produced water to a point where it can be recycled and reused,” Renk said. “The recycled water can be reused in hydraulic fracturing to reduce the oil and gas industry’s demand on freshwater.”\\n\\nThe new approach offers a range of other advantages including:\\n\\nReuse of the treated water can relieve formation pressure, which allows new oil wells to be drilled more economically.\\n\\nGHCR fluid extraction can extend the life of traditional saltwater disposal wells\\n\\nThe concept eliminates the need for surface storage of produced water and can use existing infrastructure like pipelines and wells.\\n\\nGHCR nearly eliminates the need to manage the highly concentrated brines and naturally occurring radioactive materials typically associated with produced water treatment and reuse.\\n\\nWater management is a significant technical and economic challenge for sustainable oil and gas production. North Dakota oil production rose to over 1.5 million barrels (MMbbl)/day in 2019. After a brief downturn in oil prices in early 2020, North Dakota oil production recovered to 1.1 MMbbl/day by August 2021.\\n\\n“Produced water recycling is not yet widespread,” Renk explained. “But as water management continues to be a key focal point in companies’ environmental, social and governance initiatives, focus on water management, including recycling, will continue to increase.”\\n\\nNETL conducts and supports research on energy resource sustainability efforts that: maximize resource recovery efficiency; reduce environmental impacts; lower exploration and production risks; improve natural gas transportation efficiency and resiliency; and reduce resource production costs.\\n\\nNETL partners with industry, academia, technology developers, government agencies, and other national laboratories to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of research projects throughout its portfolio.\\n\\nNETL is a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory that drives innovation and delivers technological solutions for an environmentally sustainable and prosperous energy future.

The campaign speaks to persistent calls to increase the assistance provided to households across the UK.\\n\\nRapid energy price rises have pushed millions into fuel poverty, with an estimated 9 million people spending Christmas 2022 in cold and damp homes. For many, independent advice on safely reducing energy use and accessing financial assistance can make a vital difference in confronting the combined cost of living and energy crises.\\n\\nTrustworthy advice goes far beyond a few short-term behavioural “hacks” – some of which have been rightly criticised – to also include deeper measures to upgrade the UK’s inefficient housing stock.\\n\\nTo meet its climate change targets and protect households from rising energy costs, the UK must rapidly insulate millions of homes and install low-carbon technologies such as heat pumps. But installing such measures is often complicated and there is limited information, guidance or support. The UK can’t decarbonise its energy system without increasing the help available to households from trained energy experts.\\n\\nBrian Clifford / shutterstock\\n\\nReducing the UK’s carbon emissions should go hand-in-hand with tackling fuel poverty. Inefficient housing, heating systems and appliances are key drivers of fuel poverty, and people living in well-insulated, low-carbon homes are more likely to have affordable energy bills. While advice alone will never solve fuel poverty, when combined with other measures it can make a vital contribution. Advisers can point people towards appropriate government aid and utility support schemes or help arrange debt repayment plans, or insulation and heating upgrades.\\n\\nWe know what works\\n\\nAcademic and policy experts, including ourselves, have undertaken extensive research on integrated energy advice in the UK and beyond. Numerous pilot projects across the UK and similar countries provide a useful testbed for understanding what works.\\n\\nResearch has shown there are several important factors, such as how energy advice is communicated, who is providing it, and how it is framed. The most effective forms of energy advice are those that are tailored to individual conditions, primarily via in-person, community-based and context-sensitive work.\\n\\nVitalij Terescsuk / shutterstock\\n\\nYet energy advice provision in the UK remains fragmented and insufficient, with inconsistent coverage across the country. Organisations such as Citizens Advice do brilliant work, but they don’t have the resources to provide widespread, personalised advice.\\n\\nNEAS to meet you\\n\\nOne thing that might help is the establishment of a National Energy Advice Service. Akin to the efforts involved in building the UK’s National Health Service back in the 1940s, it could provide widely accessible, free support for anyone who needs it. With dedicated funding from utilities or government, the service could help integrate all elements of the retrofit supply chain, it could reduce skills shortages and help address both fuel poverty and the transition to net zero.\\n\\nWhat does this mean in practice? People wanting to improve the energy performance of their home would be able to access a single advice line, or a website. This could either lead to an adviser visit, or advice could be provided remotely if more appropriate. The advice would allow a household to identify the best options in light of its budget and other circumstances, and any support or subsidy schemes that might be available. Perhaps most importantly, people could be pointed towards certified sellers and installers of relevant materials.\\n\\nNeil Simcock , Author provided\\n\\nThe advice service could also work directly with government agencies, the NHS and community groups to seek out and approach those who might benefit from energy efficiency upgrades. This could be done at the neighbourhood scale, through area-based targeting, community retrofit coordinators, energy cafes, or other local initiatives. Any households or businesses who sign up would be advised on support schemes and energy upgrade options.\\n\\nEveryone should have access to state-of-the-art energy measures, regardless of their income or other forms of disadvantage. The service must not be restricted to those with the confidence and resources to take the initiative.\\n\\nSo there is a strong case that this would promote energy justice. By integrating financial subsidies, and working with trustworthy installers and companies, a national-level advice service could help promote equitable access to low-carbon energy for all.',\n",
       " 'Welcome to our top picks of the latest energy regulatory and market developments in the UK\\'s transition to net zero.\\n\\nThis week we look at the government\\'s proposed reforms to the Capacity Market, the new Energy Bills Discount Scheme, the government\\'s responses to a consultation on a market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat and NG ESO\\'s yearly review.\\n\\nGovernment outlines reforms to Capacity Market\\n\\nThe government published its proposed reforms to the Capacity Market (CM) on 9 January 2023. The CM is designed to ensure security of energy supply and decrease the risk of blackouts by providing payments to encourage investment in new capacity or for existing capacity to remain open. According to the government, capacity market auctions held to date have secured the majority of Britain’s capacity needs to meet forecast peak demand out to 2025/2026. The reforms are part of its plan to deliver a net zero power system and increase security of supply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nChanges proposed to align the CM with net zero include significantly reducing the emissions intensity limits applicable to new build plants from 1 October 2034 to end \"the inconsistency between our decarbonisation commitments and the 15-year CM agreements available for unabated fossil fuel generation\". It has been proposed that carbon capture and hydrogen should be used to decarbonise and reduce the running hours of fossil fuel generators. Greener, more flexible technologies will also be incentivised to compete in CM auctions with multi-year contracts being offered for low carbon flexible capacity. These will includesmart demand side response technologies and smaller-scale electricity storage without a requirement to meet capital expenditure thresholds. The government is also seeking stakeholder views on creating pathways that would enable existing CM Units to exit multi-year contracts in order to decarbonise.\\n\\nProposals on security supply include reforms to the CM\\'s approach to performance testing in order to ensure that, as early as possible, capacity can meet demand in winter, and reforming the way that connection capacity is assessed, to ensure a higher degree of accuracy in knowing how much power a generator, battery or demand side response unit can provide to the network. The non-delivery penalty regime will also be strengthened by changing the figure used in setting the regime. It is hoped that this will make it clear to Capacity Providers that delivering in a stress event is vital to the effectiveness of the scheme.\\n\\nThe consultation on the proposed reforms opened on 9 January 2023 and will close on 3 March 2023. The government aims to publish a response in spring 2023.\\n\\nUK government announces Energy Bills Discount Scheme\\n\\nThe government has announced a new Energy Bills Discount Scheme for UK businesses, charities and the public sector.\\n\\nThis scheme will run from April 2023 for 12 months and has been announced ahead of the end of the current scheme in March of this year. It is aimed at non-domestic consumers and hopes to help those who signed contracts for their supply of energy prior to recent falls in prices. The new scheme will provide £5.5 billion of support.\\n\\nFrom 1 April 2023 non-domestic customers who have a contract with a licensed energy supplier will benefit from a discount of up to £6.97/MWh on their gas bill and to £19.61/MWh on their electricity bill, both of which will be automatically applied. The amount of discount in each case will be decided by reference to a wholesale price threshold which will be set by reference to the support given to domestic customers. The price threshold will be £107/MWh for gas and £302/MWh for electricity. Any business with costs below these levels will not receive any support.\\n\\nFor any eligible energy trade and intensive industries, the support will be in the form of a discount which reflects the difference between the price threshold and the wholesale price. The price threshold will be £99/MWh for gas and £185/MWh for electricity. This will be subject to a maximum discount of £40/MWh for gas and £89.1/MWh for electricity.\\n\\nThe government has also announced £13.6 billion of business rates bills support for businesses in England and a £2.4 billion fuel duty cut.\\n\\nUK government publishes responses to consultation on market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat\\n\\nThe government has published the responses it has received to its consultation on a market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat. The consultation set out a proposal on introducing a market-based mechanism which will support a UK market for low-carbon electric heat pumps. It sought views on the scope of technologies, the choice of target for the mechanism and scheme administration, penalties and enforcement.\\n\\nThere were 67 responses to the consultation, the majority of which were in support of the proposal. Respondents did highlight the need for wider policy changes in order to facilitate the government\\'s aims, with suggestions including consumer protection, energy pricing and public engagement.\\n\\nThose who supported the proposal generally were in favour of placing an obligation on manufacturers of fossil fuel heating appliances to meet an increasing low-carbon standard, rather than placing heat pump obligations on energy suppliers. Respondents also highlighted a desire to limit administrative complexity.\\n\\nThe responses broadly supported focusing on hydronic heat pumps over wider low-carbon technologies. They also supported excluding domestic scale heat pumps from the scope and focusing on units sold and installed rather than average efficiency of appliances.\\n\\nThe government now intends to take forward the obligation on manufacturers of fossil fuel heating appliances, in the hope it will incentivise firms to invest in the low carbon heating market. The government will also develop a mechanism based on the number of heat pump sales to end-consumers as a proportion of a firm\\'s fossil fuel boiler sales.\\n\\nNG ESO publishes its yearly review\\n\\nNational Grid ESO (NG ESO) published its 2022 review on 6 January, highlighting that 2022 was the UK\\'s second greenest year on record after 2020. The greenest day occurred on 28 December, with 52g CO2/kWh being produced. Electricity generated from wind turbines has also become a more important part of the generation mix, with over 20GW of electricity being produced by wind for the first time ever in November 2022. On 29 January 2022, 64% of energy was produced by wind. On the whole, zero carbon sources are outperforming traditional fossil fuels, by providing 48.5% of electricity this year, compared to gas and coal\\'s 40%.\\n\\nIn its annual Operability Strategy Report, NG ESO outlined its proposed solutions to the obstacles that are anticipated as it moves towards its ambition of being able to operate a network using 100% zero carbon electricity by 2025. This includes issues associated with the fact that achieving decarbonisation necessitates less dispatchable generation (such as oil and gas), more asynchronous generation, more variable sources of generation and generation moving to different areas. Asynchronous generation refers to the increase in generators connected by inverter-based technologies such as battery and solar. Newer technologies such as domestic scale solar and increased demand side participation will also need to be integrated across the system.\\n\\nThis article was written with the assistance of Saskia Zant-Boer and Hannah Wooderson, trainee solicitors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'By Pradeep Lala\\n\\nEnergy independence, the word that defined energy economics over the past few years, has gained prominence with India making significant steps towards becoming an energy-independent country by 2047. This vision is driven by sustained efforts to mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures by aligning with carbon neutrality clauses. By utilising the force of clean technology and renewable sources to drive change, green buildings, which evolved as a response to India’s rapid and ongoing trend towards being energy efficient, have gradually transformed and enhanced energy requirements.\\n\\nThe indigenous nature of clean sources gives local economies an advantage. Countries across the globe have been able to diversify their economies, protect themselves from the unpredictable price fluctuations of fossil fuels, promote inclusive economic growth, and generate employment by utilising renewable sources of energy. By 2030, electricity generated from renewable sources can account for 65% of the world’s total electrical production. This could decarbonize 90% of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to lessen the harmful effects of climate change.\\n\\nIndia is now ranked fourth in the world in terms of renewable energy generation. Our current solar capacity is around 61.79 GW, up from 2.6 MW eight years ago. The contribution of renewable energy sources is about 40.7% (166.36 GW) of the total installed capacity. In line with various initiatives and policies introduced by the government, it encourages investment in the clean energy industry. India currently has a capacity for non-fossil fuel-based clean energy and includes nuclear plants of 6.78 GW, totaling up to 173 GW of clean energy, and projects with a capacity of 80 GW are being built to meet its goal of producing 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030.\\n\\nOrganizations across industries are establishing more stringent Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals to reduce their environmental impact, effectively address consumer concerns and expectations, and support corporate commitments to reduce carbon emissions while managing financial risk and upholding accountability. This delineates an organisation’s goodwill and long-term environmental stewardship toward all stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the public. Many organisations have discovered that using solar energy is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to swiftly achieve major environmental and sustainability related ESG goals.\\n\\nToday, the trend of sustainability and renewable energy is quite prevalent in the real estate sector. To support India’s NDC, this sector needs to decarbonize by integrating renewable energy and energy-efficient strategies. Nearly 40% of annual global CO2 emissions come from this sector, and older infrastructure often makes a bigger contribution. Businesses can minimise their net carbon emissions and contribute towards mitigating the effects of climate change by implementing clean and sustainable facility management solutions.\\n\\nFor organisations to achieve their net-zero emission goals, the facility management sector will need to take a holistic and strategic approach that includes waste reduction, sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. This includes retrofitting the building envelope and HVAC system, installing energy-efficient lighting, and using smart building technology to optimise energy use.\\n\\nAdditionally, the facility domain can also build on-site renewable energy equipment, such as solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, to provide clean, renewable energy and explore the potential of green power. An integrated facility management organisation has several facets: its operations, investments, management, and services intertwine, making sustainability the core of its operations. Green buildings that employ renewable energy often experience a 10% reduction in operating expenses in the first year. Planning preventive maintenance increases cost-effectiveness, equipment lifespans, and sustainability in a conducive manner.\\n\\nAlso Read Hydrogen as alternative fuel gathering momentum\\n\\nAn extraordinary evolution up and down the entire energy value chain is necessary to realise India’s vision of energy independence. As efforts are being undertaken to achieve this vision, businesses need to be cognizant of their carbon production and emission levels, as well as deploy smart and scalable facility management solutions that address this gap. The facility management sector will continue to play an instrumental role in empowering India’s commitment towards becoming a carbon-neutral economy.\\n\\n(Pradeep Lala, Managing Director & CEO, Embassy Services Private Limited.

Mike Dunleavy outlined proposed legislation Thursday for Alaska to capitalize on carbon markets, seeking to diversify state revenues long heavily reliant on proceeds from oil.\\n\\nDunleavy plans to introduce his so-called a carbon management bill package during the legislative session that begins next week.\\n\\nThe Republican governor and members of his administration outlined the proposal at a news conference in Anchorage. Dunleavy said in a statement that he wants lawmakers to seriously consider it as a “cornerstone of a long-term fiscal solution'' that would complement revenue from oil and gas and Alaska's nest-egg investment fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund. The state has relied heavily on oil revenue and earnings from the permanent fund to help pay for state government.\\n\\nDunleavy has suggested a range of rough estimates for what carbon projects might yield. Last month, in raising the carbon concept while releasing his budget plan, he said the ``amount of money you can derive from this carbon process, that's difficult to put a finger on, but I would say this, we haven't even begun to calculate the sequestration concept in terms of monetization.'' He said experts would help with that process.\\n\\nThe Congressional Research Service said in a report on carbon capture and sequestration in October that congressional interest in addressing climate change has increased interest in carbon capture and sequestration. But it added, that ``debate continues as to what role, if any, CCS should play in greenhouse gas emissions reductions.''\\n\\nWhile some policymakers and other interested parties see carbon capture and sequestration as an option to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, others worry it “may encourage continued fossil fuel use'' or that carbon dioxide could leak from underground reservoirs, the report stated.\\n\\nDunleavy's office said the new legislation would set out rules for potential storage of carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations and for a carbon offsets program.\\n\\nDunleavy said he sees a carbon initiative as standing alongside existing industries such as oil and gas, mining and timber.\\n\\n“This is not a displacer of industry,'' he said Thursday. “This is just a brand-new opportunity that will enhance and work hand-in-glove with the industries that we currently have.''\\n\\n© 2023 The Canadian Press\",\n",

       " 'TORONTO, CANADA and MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA, Jan. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hydrostor Inc. (Hydrostor), a leading long-duration energy storage (LDES) provider, and Central Coast Community Energy (3CE), one of California’s largest community choice aggregators, announced today that they have executed a 25-year energy storage PPA for 200 MW/1,600 MWh from Hydrostor’s 100%-owned Willow Rock Energy Storage Center (Willow Rock). Using Hydrostor’s patented Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) solution, Willow Rock will abate up to 28 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime, equivalent to removing 120,000+ cars from the road, each year, for 50+ years.\\n\\nExpanding critical long-duration energy storage (LDES) to support increasing levels of intermittent wind and solar resources\\n\\nThe nearly $1B (U.S.) contract represents one of the largest standalone long-duration energy storage PPAs, providing 8 hours of energy storage to Central Coast Community Energy\\n\\nOnce completed, the project will help 3CE provide 100% clean and renewable energy to more than 440,000 customers by 2030 and support up to 40 full time operating positions, and $500 million in regional direct and indirect impacts to the local economy\\n\\nprovide 100% clean and renewable energy to more than 440,000 customers by 2030 and support up to 40 full time operating positions, and $500 million in regional direct and indirect impacts to the local economy Assuming 100% renewable energy mix, Hydrostor’s 500 MW Willow Rock Center will abate up to 28 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime, equivalent to removing 120,000+ cars from the road, each year, for 50+ years\\n\\nAs California advances towards its objective of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, the state will require large-scale LDES to support increasing levels of intermittent wind and solar generation capacity. Willow Rock provides a cost-effective, emission-free storage solution to convert California’s abundant renewable resources into reliable, on-demand peaking capacity.\\n\\nLocated just outside Rosamond in Kern County, California, Willow Rock will have the ability to deliver 500 MW of clean power for up to 8 hours. The facility will charge using surplus renewable energy and discharge to the grid at times of higher demand, reducing the need for new peak-demand generating facilities and deferring the need for costly, difficult-to-permit transmission lines. The facility will be capable of emission-free charge and discharge and operate on a footprint of fewer than 100 acres, significantly smaller than a comparable pumped hydro power (PHP) facility, which represents 90%+ of all LDES capacity today.\\n\\nA-CAES will accelerate the pathway to decarbonized energy systems globally, enabling energy storage for extended periods using compressed air, underground caverns, and water, with no performance degradation over a 50+ year lifetime. The execution of this PPA demonstrates the strength of Hydrostor’s solution and the importance of alternatives to PHP and chemical batteries for long-duration energy storage.\\n\\n“Storage is the most critical piece in the transition to renewable energy,” said 3CE Chief Operating Officer, Robert Shaw. “We continue to support and press for new technologies to eliminate dependence on fossil fuels in our communities. In doing so, we are also helping to clean California’s grid and developing a pathway for other areas to follow.”\\n\\nImportantly, A-CAES employs proven components from the hydrocarbon sector to build energy storage systems that are highly scalable and flexibly sited. As a result, A-CAES also delineates a clear pathway for skillsets and expertise from the fossil fuel industry to play a central role in the global energy transition. Willow Rock will provide up to 40 full-time operating positions and US$500 million in regional direct and indirect impacts to the local economy.\\n\\n“We look forward to serving the 440,000+ 3CE customers in California and demonstrating that long-term, reliable access to large-scale renewable energy can be achieved with A-CAES,” said Hydrostor Chief Commercial Officer, Jordan Cole. “This is a truly groundbreaking step towards accomplishing net-zero targets on time – one that illustrates the commercial maturity of our A-CAES solution and the leadership of 3CE to responsibly accomplish net-zero by 2030.”\\n\\nCurtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor’s CEO, added, “We remain steadfast in our commitment to key stakeholders in the energy transition, and we commend 3CE on their world-leading efforts. It is in Hydrostor’s DNA to be a scaled enabler of global decarbonization, and Willow Rock embodies the size of infrastructure that is required to achieve ambitious net-zero targets in California and internationally.”\\n\\nThis milestone marks the first of several towards allocating the full 500 MW capacity of Willow Rock, and offtake discussions are ongoing with several parties for the balance of total output.\\n\\nAttachment',\n",

       " 'Climate Rules Are About to Become Real for International Trade\\n\\nInternational trade is skewed in favor of exporters who pay less for carbon emissions. The EU wants to change that.\\n\\nIn 2023, climate rules in international trade become real.\\n\\nWith the introduction of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), trade rules based on the carbon footprint of goods move from theory to practice. In December 2022, EU institutions reached overall agreement on the CBAM regulation, which will come into force later this year.\\n\\nThe CBAM’s purpose is to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, which can arise when differences in climate policy make it cheaper to produce carbon-intensive products in one country compared to another.\\n\\nThe EU operates an Emissions Trading System (ETS) that caps overall emissions from covered sectors such as energy, heavy industry and aluminium production. Within the cap, emitters must surrender to the regulator enough emission allowances to cover their total emissions. Emitters can buy and sell allowances for this purpose. The EU allowance, representing one tonne of CO2 equivalent, has recently been trading at around $85.\\n\\nThe problem is that most of the countries the EU trades with have a far lower carbon price – or no carbon price at all. This creates an unfair advantage for exporters to the EU who do not have to pay the cost of carbon to produce their products. It also creates perverse incentives: for governments to support their exporters by keeping carbon prices low or non-existent, and for businesses to relocate production to those jurisdictions – i.e. carbon leakage.\\n\\nThe CBAM deals with these problems by requiring importers into the EU of covered goods to pay the difference between the EU carbon price and the carbon price (if any) under which the goods were actually produced. The EU carbon price is thereby factored into the final price of the good, eliminating incentives for carbon leakage.\\n\\nTo begin with, the CBAM will be applied only to a limited number of sectors where there is risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, fertilizers, aluminum, electricity and hydrogen. Importers must begin CBAM reporting from October this year and must start making payments under the mechanism from 2026. No big deal? Here’s why it matters.\\n\\nFirst, the EU is likely to expand the CBAM to other goods, with the European Commission to review this during the transition period. Further EU decisions last month to phase out freely allocated emissions allowances and to strengthen the ETS mitigation target will put upward pressure on the price of EU carbon credits. Both CBAM price and coverage are therefore likely to go up.\\n\\nSecond, the impact of the CBAM will be much broader than direct exports to the EU in covered sectors. Its real point is to incentivize other countries to adopt sufficiently robust carbon pricing. The draft regulation provides for the CBAM not to be applied to exports from such countries. Even before it enters into force, the CBAM is having this impact. The World Bank reports that “[s]everal jurisdictions, including Ukraine, Uruguay, and Taiwan, China, have already cited the CBAM proposal as a driver for their efforts to adopt a direct carbon price.\"\\n\\nThe draft regulation foresees international agreements on carbon pricing adequacy leading to an “alliance of countries with carbon pricing instruments or other comparable instruments (‘climate club’).\" This is intended to “pave the way for global carbon pricing.\" While this is clearly a long way off, other major economies have also been considering carbon border adjustments.\\n\\nThird, the CBAM agreement shows that EU climate policy has not been derailed by the crisis caused by Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine. Quite the opposite. The CBAM was proposed in 2019, the legislation was introduced in 2021 and political agreement reached in 2022.\\n\\nIn fact, the EU has not only stayed the course but has used both the Covid-19 economic recovery packages and its response to Russian energy blackmail to accelerate climate policy. Other countries have done similarly, although globally it’s a mixed picture.\\n\\nCertain vested interests have been quietly (or not so quietly) hoping that the immediate challenges of war and pestilence would consign climate policy to the too-hard basket. They should probably give up. The climate transition is now a broadly recognized driver of energy security, economic prosperity and social resilience. As the Paris Agreement requires, countries are progressively strengthening climate goals and implementation, although not quickly enough.\\n\\nExporters to the EU will have an additional reason to reduce the carbon intensity of covered products. By far the larger impact, however, will be if the CBAM works as intended, spurring other major economies to introduce or strengthen domestic carbon taxes or emissions trading. Each country with a high carbon price will have the same incentive as the EU to adopt carbon border adjustments.\\n\\nStephen Minas is associate professor at the School of Transnational Law, Peking University and senior research fellow at the Transnational Law Institute, King’s College London, where he completed a PhD in law.

They say it\\'s increasingly likely that climate change is making weather events more intense, more frequent or of longer duration.\\n\\nIt\\'s punching up temperatures in heat waves and adding some percentage of rainfall to intense storms. It also may cause weather events to occur outside times or locations where they typically happened in the past.\\n\\nBut what is causing climate change? Why are global temperatures rising? And is the warming climate to blame for wild weather events? Here’s some key information:\\n\\nWhat does climate change mean?\\n\\nWeather is what you see outside the window. Climate is what occurs in an area over years or decades. Climate change is the difference seen in long-term trends in air, water and ocean temperatures and longer-term weather patterns.\\n\\nMonitoring stations around the world add to a growing trove of information that reveals how temperature and rainfall are changing. Some have decades of measurements, while others have more than a century of data.

       " 'On the 27th and 28th of October, representatives of the EU institutions, Member States, NGOs, business leaders, and academia met at the Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Forum, where stakeholders, representatives of the EU institutions and EU Member States discussed how to best deploy carbon capture in order to ensure Europe meets its climate goals. Last year’s CCUS Forum was followed by a year of momentum for carbon capture in Europe. European nations are developing policies and supporting the development of a record 73 projects across the continent.\\n\\nTo continue this momentum, the European Commission deepened the format of the CCUS Forum by establishing three working groups to deliver a strategic vision for carbon capture development in Europe and ensure discussions and exchange among stakeholders. Within this expanded format, Clean Air Task Force took part in the two-day Forum in Oslo as co-chair of the Vision working group.\\n\\nThe headline grabbing highlight from this event was the announcement that the Commission will be releasing a communication on a strategic vision for carbon capture in Europe in the Spring of 2023. But let’s go beyond the headlines and take a look at some of the key takeaways from this year’s CCUS Forum:\\n\\n1. Europe cannot achieve its climate objectives without Carbon Capture: “No CCS, no Green Deal.”\\n\\n“I believe that CCUS has incredible potential in our race to reach climate neutrality. And without CCS and CCU, it will be practically impossible to limit the global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius objective.” – Kadri Simson, EU Commissioner for Energy\\n\\nThe importance of carbon capture for the achievement of Europe’s climate targets was made clear by the Commissioner in her opening keynote speech at the Forum. This point was further emphasised by Professor Christopher Jones of the Florence School of Regulation with the slogan “no CCUS, no Green Deal.” The Commissioner cited the EU’s climate modelling which “shows a need to capture and utilise or store between 300 and 640 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 to meet its climate goals.” This is in line with both Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) modelling for Europe, which state the need for 637 Mt and 350 Mt of CO 2 captured respectively.\\n\\nThe Commissioner outlined that the forthcoming Communication will aim to quantify the potential role of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage, clarify the rules governing CO 2 infrastructure, and look for ways to better involve industry and other stakeholders. In order to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture in Europe, a clear vision is needed to provide direction and confidence to the sector, while addressing the issues of funding, infrastructure, and regulation which have held back these technologies to date, with deployment far behind the pace required.\\n\\nCarbon removals will also be needed for the EU to meet its climate targets and as Oliver Geden, Senior Fellow at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and Lead Author of the IPCC AR6 stated, “If you have a net zero target then you are already committed to carbon removal, otherwise it is a zero emissions target.” This reflects the need for residual emissions to be removed with technologies such as direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). In this regulatory space, the recently released EU proposal for a Carbon Removal Certification Framework is a welcome step. The challenge facing the removals industry is substantial: the number of operational facilities delivering permanent carbon removals is almost non-existent today, and they will need to rapidly reach gigatonne scale globally by 2050.\\n\\n2. To reach scale, the carbon capture community must build public support.\\n\\n“When we have new technologies and projects it is related with concerns, broadening the awareness of CCS projects is key to the success of projects.” – Agnieszka Baran, Project ECO2PL\\n\\nWhile momentum has been growing for carbon capture, the industry still needs to scale up a hundredfold by 2050 to play its essential role in limiting global temperature rise. Christopher Davies put this in context by describing the “need to build a 400,000-tonne [CO 2 per year] capacity plant every 8 days between now and 2050 to achieve the EU’s climate targets.” Delivering a keynote speech on day two, Brad Crabtree, Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management at the U.S. Department of Energy, highlighted how “the biggest barrier to deployment, whether in the U.S. or Europe, is cost” and that, to bring these costs down there is a need for “projects, projects, projects.”\\n\\nThe recent doubling of the EU’s Innovation Fund to €3 billion for its third call is welcome news for project developers. The Innovation Fund has already selected a total of 11 carbon capture, utilisation, and storage projects for significant funding under its first two calls. However, this can only go so far in addressing the €10 billion funding gap for announced projects. To support project development, there is a need for new industrial partnerships along with incentives that can support the carbon capture ‘hub’ approach for scalable climate impact. While the need for large-scale projects was evident, an ongoing role for research and development was also emphasised as a means to scale-up the technology and to lower costs.\\n\\nForum speakers also emphasised that ensuring public support and acceptance for carbon capture will be vital. Georg Indrevik, mayor of the town of Øygarden, home to the Northern Lights project and its associated visitor centre, spoke about the need to ensure transparency and ensure “everything is open book.” Addressing public concerns around the safety of these technologies will be paramount: communicating clearly that carbon capture is a safe, effective, and needed method of climate change mitigation, can help bring people onside and ensure that projects overcome development hurdles.\\n\\n3. There is a need to scale the whole carbon capture value chain and tackle the ‘chicken-and-egg’ challenge.\\n\\n“Europe has great possibility and potential for storage. However, the uptake is all too slow, and we have the chicken-and-egg problem.” – Per-Olof Granström, EU Director, the Zero Emissions Platform\\n\\nThe ‘chicken and egg’ paradox was cited repeatedly to illustrate a particular challenge for carbon capture and storage, reflecting the need to scale the full value chain. A capture plant will not start operating until the captured CO 2 can be transported and then permanently stored at a storage site. And developers of storage facilities wait to invest until they know that there will be captured CO 2 for them to store. CATF’s analysis estimates that by 2030 the available storage capacity in Europe will cover only half of the volume of captured CO 2 . To solve this, there must be a concerted, whole-sector approach to carbon capture development and deployment, connecting emitters with the transport and storage operators, the EU and Member States, to ensure that projects develop as one. As put by Pavan Chilukuri, CCUS Lead at Holcim, there is a need for “a common public infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage”, as industries where carbon capture will be required do not have specialisation in CO 2 storage or transport. Europe-wide infrastructure can solve this problem, but it must be supported by policies such as amendments to the TEN-T regulation to include multiple modalities for the transport of CO 2 .\\n\\nNorway’s Longship project, which is sponsored by the Norwegian government, aims to solve this problem by supporting the whole value chain of CO 2 capture, transport, and storage. Captured emissions from sources such as Norcem’s Brevik cement plant or Celsio’s energy recovery plant in Oslo will be transported by tankship and stored deep underground using Northern Lights’ open-access CO 2 transport and storage infrastructure. The estimated storage capacity in the Norwegian North Sea amounts to around 70 billion tonnes of CO 2 . Nonetheless, the need to explore other storage areas in Europe and the value of an Europe-wide atlas for CO 2 storage sites were highlighted. A storage atlas would aid countries and project developers without ready access to the North Sea in easily identifying and assessing potential storage sites.\\n\\n4. There is a need for a new regulatory framework for the transport of CO 2 .\\n\\n“Standardisation: It’s crucial. It’s even more important when looking at project delivery. It simplifies communication so everyone knows what to do and how to do it.” – Bastian Gerstner-Riewer, Head of Project Development, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\\n\\nDue to the uneven distribution of storage sites across Europe, there is a need for mutually compatible and flexible trans-European infrastructure for the transport of CO 2 . Along with this infrastructure, cross-border cooperation – both between Member States and with non-member countries – will be essential in ensuring that all EU countries have access to CO 2 storage sites, enabling carbon capture technologies to develop and ensuring a level playing field across the EU. Presently, there is a patchwork of regulations across the EU which make it harder for CO 2 transport projects to begin due to regulatory uncertainty.\\n\\nClosing legal gaps will “give certainty and enable business models for early movers to work,” said Veronika Elgart, Deputy Head of the Rio Conventions Section at the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment. Transport networks will help to reduce the costs associated with these projects through economies of scale, as well as reducing risks by providing a wider portfolio of sinks and sources.\\n\\nIt will be important for these networks to be developed in a coordinated and harmonised manner with compatible regulatory protocols, the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and the Trans-European Network for Energy (TEN-E), and ensure that standardisation and trust are maintained across the carbon capture value chain.\\n\\n5. Carbon capture will be required for Europe’s industries to remain competitive.\\n\\n“Two-thirds of our emissions are process emissions… so it is absolutely clear we need CCUS in our process.” – Winston Beck, Head of Government Affairs, Heidelberg Materials\\n\\nCarbon capture is often the cheapest and in some cases, the only option for the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries, some of which have process emissions that are practically impossible to decarbonise with renewable energy. These include vital sectors such as the cement, steel, fertiliser and chemical production industries. Demand for concrete and steel, for example, is only set to increase in the coming years.\\n\\nKeeping EU industries competitive will be conditional on ensuring that they decarbonise and align with the EU’s climate targets. Carbon capture will also be vital in creating a low-carbon hydrogen industry in Europe, decarbonising the existing hydrogen infrastructure, and allowing for the creation of more low-carbon hydrogen production, while renewable energy capacity is increased, first to decarbonize the electricity grid, and then to facilitate renewable hydrogen production.\\n\\n6. Europe still needs a comprehensive carbon capture and storage strategy.\\n\\n“We are happy that a strategy is going to be developed for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. But it needs to be very clear and very ambitious.” – Liv Rathe, Director, Norske Hydro\\n\\nThe news of a Communication on a strategic vision for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage is welcome and shows that carbon capture is firmly on the EU agenda. It is imperative that the Communication include targets, volumes, and timelines to drive carbon capture forward at the pace necessary. Johan Borje of Stockholm Exergi described the current regulatory and market landscape in Europe as in a “kindergarten phase;” to graduate carbon capture out of this phase an EU strategy is required.\\n\\nCATF has outlined what a comprehensive policy framework for carbon capture and storage in Europe could look like here. Such a strategy would provide the direction of travel for carbon capture with a European objective that catalyses projects, research and development, and industrial partnerships. It was clear from the deliberations that any such strategy should complement the already existing Directive on CO 2 Storage and other relevant EU policies.\\n\\nMomentum and enthusiasm are clearly building in the sector; however, time is of the essence, and in the words of Commissioner Simson, “the potential impact of these technologies is too important to leave to chance.”',\n",
       " 'Last week saw the publication of the highly anticipated Net Zero Review, led by Chris Skidmore MP, which cited the need to increase the deployment and adoption of low carbon technologies in a bid to reach the UK’s net zero targets.\\n\\nThe Mission Zero: Independent Review of Net Zero publication collected over 1,800 responses to its call for evidence and held more than 50 roundtables in a bid to collect enough evidence to guide the UK’s net zero prospects and support the energy transition.\\n\\nThe importance of investment\\n\\nOne of the most prominent outcomes from the review is the economic impact that net zero could have on the UK. The publication indicated that “net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century” and should be actively pursued to increase the prosperity of the nation.\\n\\nThis could open up various crucial areas of development across the nation, including the creation of green jobs and supporting neighbouring countries in their own net zero ambitions.\\n\\nRenewableUK’s CEO Dan McGrail highlighted the importance in creating a viable investment opportunity in the UK’s renewable sector and called on the UK government to support such means.\\n\\n“Chris Skidmore’s review emphasises the importance of creating a tax and regulatory environment which encourages investment into the UK at a time when we are struggling to compete for investment against countries with attractive incentives for renewable energy like the USA,” McGrail said.\\n\\n“That\\'s why it\\'s vital that the government considers the signals Treasury is sending to clean energy investors following the introduction of the Electricity Generators Levy, which kicked in at the start of this year and is now putting investment at risk.\\n\\n“A stable policy environment is vital at a time renewable developers and their supply chain are under massive financial pressures just like any other sector, to ensure we maximise investment in renewables. Given this, the government needs to look at what more could be done to increase investor confidence.”\\n\\nThe review indicated that the UK could be able to take advantage of this growing economic interest in renewable technologies. However, there is a requirement to act decisively in order to capitalise on this opportunity, which McKinsey has estimated could be worth up to £1 trillion for British businesses by 2030. However, investment will be required to help achieve this.\\n\\n“The opportunity for the UK to lead the way on net zero will not come for free and the need for investment comes at a time when there are competing priorities for public funds,” said Rob Doepel, UK and Ireland managing partner at EY Sustainability.\\n\\n“To achieve its goals, the government must accelerate the mobilisation of private sector capital to ensure the UK invests in net zero and can finance the large-scale infrastructure projects we will need.”\\n\\n“This is too important to get wrong.” 📢\\n\\n\\n\\nWe welcome many elements of #missionzero, the outcome of @CSkidmoreUK\\'s Net Zero review. It’s great to see #solar and #onshorewind in the top 3 priorities, plus the grid and infrastructure needed to support them.https://t.co/k7u7i1pssz pic.twitter.com/EUivp8rhTJ — Thrive Renewables (@Thrive_R) January 13, 2023\\n\\nThe establishment of renewable targets\\n\\nAs stated by Doepel, McGrail, and also emphasised within the review itself, there is a need for investment opportunities to arise in the UK renewable sector for the nation to achieve its net zero ambitions. Increasing investor confidence in low carbon technologies by facilitating renewable enhancing policies could provide a crucial stepping-stone in accelerating innovation and adoption.\\n\\nIn particular, the inclusion of targets for onshore wind and solar capacity, which the review believed should stand at 70GW by 2035, could unlock new private investment in the renewable sector, McGrail stated.\\n\\n“If the government is looking to increase the economic benefits of the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions, the review sets out some really clear easy wins,\" McGrail said. \"Setting targets for new onshore wind and solar capacity would certainly increase investor confidence and ensure we can decarbonise our electricity system by 2035.”\\n\\nThe solar sector in particular has welcomed the call for a 70GW solar target by 2035. There have been increasing calls for the establishment of a higher solar generation capacity – particularly in Scotland.\\n\\n“It’s no surprise that solar energy, one of the cheapest and greenest sources of power, has been backed so strongly in Chris Skidmore’s review of how to reach net zero while maximising economic growth,” said Solar Energy UK chief executive Chris Hewett.\\n\\n“We very much hope that Whitehall will embrace his calls to establish a joint taskforce with the solar industry to work on a roadmap for reaching 70GW of solar by 2035 – about four and a half times what we have now.”\\n\\nTo help attain these newly established targets, the review proposed the creation of taskforces and roadmaps to help guide the UK’s renewable future and ensure many of the pre-established targets are attained. In doing so, there will be increased confidence in developing renewable projects.\\n\\n“We welcome the recommendations to establish taskforces for solar, onshore and offshore wind, as well as the calls to align government, regulators and industry to create accelerated deployment roadmaps and greater regulatory integration,” said Doepel.\\n\\n“These steps should help to reduce much of the red tape that has accumulated across many years of incremental policy and regulation; doing so will be crucial in rapidly accelerating our national energy transition.”\\n\\nHewett additionally welcomed the creation of taskforces – particularly for the solar industry. With this, he has already identified one of the most crucial areas the taskforce must address – grid connectivity.\\n\\n“The number one priority of this group will have to be unblocking access to the grid – which is pushing back the completion of many large projects well into the next decade. In time, it should lead to a sector deal, like those agreed for aerospace, construction, offshore wind power and other industries,” Hewett said.\\n\\nAlongside clearing the substantial grid connectivity delays witnessed in the UK energy sector, the Skidmore review also called for a reform of the planning system to help enable the creation of renewable generation projects – a call that has been echoed by industry.\\n\\n“We echo Mr Skidmore’s call for reforms to our planning system, putting decarbonisation at the heart of local action, and backing businesses to go green,” said Phil Thompson, CEO of Balance Power.\\n\\nToday\\'s Net Zero Review shows lack of progress on #NetZero tech - eg onshore wind and home efficiency - are only adding to #EnergyBill for British households and taxpayers.\\n\\n\\n\\nECIU\\'s full comment & background briefing, inc from @jessralston2 >> https://t.co/HJMehHML2u pic.twitter.com/MBnU1n34QK — ECIU (@ECIU_UK) January 13, 2023\\n\\nNot enough for low carbon heating\\n\\nThe Net Zero Review investigated a range of technologies and one that continues to draw more questions is the decarbonisation of homes – especially regarding heating. Many in the industry agree with the assumption made in the review that heating is “one of the biggest decarbonisation challenges facing the UK” and more needs to be done by the government to support this sector.\\n\\n“Chris Skidmore’s thorough review rightly highlights that one of the biggest decarbonisation challenges facing us is how we heat our homes. Too much policy uncertainty and a lack of action means that the government is currently far from reaching its target of having 600,000 heat pumps installed every year from 2028; last year we only reached 10% of that target,” said Steven Ashurst, head of heat at LCP Delta.\\n\\n“The report highlights the impact of a lack of relevant skills that are needed to sell, install and maintain low carbon heating solutions and we agree that without action, we cannot expect a vibrant low carbon heating market to develop.\\n\\n“However, we would warn government from placing too much emphasis on focusing solely on air source heat pumps as a silver bullet solution. By putting in place clear signals, such as legislating for a ban on high carbon emitting boilers, this will enable a market to develop for low carbon heating solutions that is both competitive and provides quality to customers.”\\n\\nDespite this, one solution that hadn’t been highlighted as a prominent area to support is energy efficiency. This has brought scrutiny from Jonathan Maxwell, founder and CEO of Sustainable Development Capital.\\n\\n“Of course, we welcome the recommendations that relate to energy efficiency, and in particular support the proposals for regulations to be set for existing buildings to achieve minimum energy efficiency standards by 2030 and the need for the public sector to lead by example. But there is an urgent need for the government to do much more, and much more quickly,” Maxwell said.\\n\\n“We are astonished that none of the ‘ten priority missions’ involve the largest and lowest cost source of carbon emission reductions and productivity gains for the UK, which is energy efficiency improvements in the commercial, industrial, public and transport sectors. Energy efficiency for households is identified as a priority, but this is dealing with a smaller part of the biggest problem.\\n\\n“Efficiency should be the priority. We simply don’t have the time or energy to waste.”',\n",

Guided by the Master Plan, Korea will deliver on our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality in a more systematic manner.\\n\\nIf the special strategic partnership between Korea and the UAE further extends to cooperation in achieving carbon neutrality, our two countries will be able to enhance our leadership in the international community and create more opportunities for economic cooperation.\\n\\nIf our two countries join efforts in clean energy development ranging from renewable energy, hydrogen, to carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS), in addition to our existing cooperation area of nuclear power, which is symbolic of our friendship, it will not only enhance our two countries’ energy security but also contribute to improving the global energy market’s stability.\\n\\nSmart city construction is another area where synergy from our bilateral cooperation is expected.\\n\\nBy tapping into Korea’s world-class IT and infrastructure technologies and the UAE’s experience of building and operating ‘Masdar’, our two countries can bring a sustainable future to many cities around the world.\\n\\nDistinguished guests,\\n\\nThis year’s ‘Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week’ holds significant meaning, as it is an event bridging the UNFCCC COP27 held last year and this year’s COP28 in the UAE.\\n\\nDuring this year’s COP, the inaugural Global Stocktake, a process to take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, will conclude. In other words, COP28 will be a conference where the parties should devise specific ways to mobilise the finance for the climate change-driven loss and damage borne by developing countries.\\n\\nAs a responsible member of the international community and a longtime friend of the UAE, Korea is committed to providing all our support for the successful hosting of COP28.\\n\\nBy hosting the Korea Global Adaptation Week in August this year, Korea will make further progress in the discussion on how the world should adapt to the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nIn addition, by scaling up our green ODA, we will make tangible contributions to narrowing the gaps between the developed and developing countries in responding to climate change.\\n\\nCarbon neutrality has become a common slogan for the entire world, and it cannot be achieved by a single country’s effort alone.\\n\\nI am confident that if we join our hands and work together, we can be a step closer to a sustainable future based on carbon neutrality.\\n\\nI look forward to Korea and the UAE’s strengthening solidarity and cooperation to achieve our shared goal of reaching carbon neutrality.',\n",

The sources said the government intended to publish the market\\'s rules soon.\\n\\nDetails would be announced next year, said a third person, Samrat Sengupta, vice-president for new businesses and market strategy at carbon offsetter EKI Energy Ltd, which has been briefed by the government.\\n\\nIn creating a carbon market, a country sets a limit on emissions and then allocates a corresponding quantity of tradable permits, or credits, to emitters. The quantity reduces over time. If a company wants to emit more, it can buy more credits at the market price, but it will also consider whether constraining or even cutting its emissions might more profitable.\\n\\nThe source said the federal government would set up the stabilisation fund. Exactly how it would work and where the money would come from was still under discussion.\\n\\nThe second source said the World Bank had shown interest in financing the carbon market if a stabilisation mechanism were created. The bank extended an $8 million grant to India in 2016/17.\\n\\n\"The World Bank continues to remain committed to support India in developing a carbon trading market and other instruments to help scale up financing for key climate transitions,\" it said in an email to Reuters.\\n\\nIndia\\'s Power Ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.\\n\\nThe plans for creating a stabilisation fund and funding details have not been reported previously. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nBeginning in 2008, prices of carbon credits in other countries slumped heavily, because of that year\\'s economic crisis and because governments had issued too many of them.\\n\\nIn the European Union, a credit worth 1 tonne of carbon dioxide traded at just 5 euros in 2012, down from around 30 euros in 2008, so cutting emissions was not very rewarding. But creation of a market stability reserve in 2019, among other measures, has seen the price rise to between 75 and 95 euros per tonne.\\n\\nMarket landscape\\n\\nThe Indian market would cover emissions of carbon dioxide and also five other greenhouse gases valued in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalence, the sources said.\\n\\nPower Minister R.K. Singh said last week the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission would probably be the market regulator.\\n\\nIn a part of the planned market to be called the compliance market, participation would be obligatory for entities in a dozen sectors, such as oil refining, steel, aluminium and cement, the sources said. Another part, the voluntary market, would be open to other entities.\\n\\nIndia already has a market for trading certificates in above-target energy savings. Entities in 13 sectors must participate.\\n\\nGreen energy companies formed a group in October to mediate between the government and industry. They included Adani Green, owned by billionaire Gautam Adani, Hero Future Energies, Ayana Renewable Power and global private equity major KKR\\'s Virescent Infra.\\n\\nThe targets for reducing each sector\\'s emissions will be set by committees of the environment, power and renewable energy ministries, the two officials said.\\n\\nIndia\\'s carbon market is being set up in two phases, according to the government\\'s presentation slides. In the first phase, between 2023 and 2025, the existing energy-savings certificates will be converted to carbon credits.\\n\\nThe government was still considering whether the new market would subsume one in which certificates for renewable energy generation are traded, the two officials said.\\n\\nIndia has committed to cutting its ratio of greenhouse emissions to gross domestic product by 2030 to 45% of its 2005 level and to net zero by 2070.',\n",

More than 100 calls came in to the Clarksville Fire Department since the early morning of Christmas Eve, and the problem also affected parts of New Albany and Jeffersonville.The dangerous levels seemed to subside once the natural gas was shut off to homes, said Brandon Skaggs, chief of the Clarksville Fire Department.Nevertheless, Skaggs hesitated to blame CenterPoint Energy, which provides gas to the affected area.\"I don\\'t have a cause or proof or anything like that,\" he said.In a statement, CenterPoint acknowledged mixing propane in with natural gas over the weekend to address high demand from the bitter cold but said the practice is common in extreme weather events.The utility also found \"improper appliance venting\" in the majority of calls it responded to, an issue that could have been exacerbated by the stress the extreme cold placed upon those appliances, according to the statement.A WLKY reporter interviewed a spokesperson for the utility by phone and asked why such problems only seemed to affect one particular geographic area.\"I understand exactly what you\\'re pointing to, and we just don\\'t have a good explanation for that at this time,\" said Alyssia Oshodi, communications manager with CenterPoint.In the meantime, the Clarksville Fire Department is urging residents to install carbon monoxide detectors and make sure they are working properly.\"The initial carbon monoxide and gas smell calls have decreased significantly, but now you have that public fear,\" Skaggs said.The first call came around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, when two south Clarksville residents complained of chest pains, he said.The Clarksville Fire Department went on to respond to 50 more calls that day alone, he said. At least four people were transported to local hospitals, but Skaggs said he believes many more took themselves to emergency rooms and urgent care centers.The issue was so severe that an emergency command center had to be set up at the fire department\\'s headquarters. Symptoms of overexposure to carbon monoxide include chest pains, headache, fatigue, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea and unconsciousness.Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to call 911 immediately.',\n",
       " 'Written by GARY D. ROBERTSON\\n\\nEnvironmental and renewable energy groups have challenged the proposal by Duke Energy Corp. subsidiaries on how to reduce greenhouse gases in North Carolina in the next decade, saying it relies too much on natural gas and unproven technologies to succeed.\\n\\nThe groups, in filing a formal response to the proposed electricity-production shifts the utility offered in May to the state Utilities Commission, also make an alternate proposal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. They say it would require more solar and wind power and battery storage use than Duke’s plan.\\n\\nThe coalition says its plan would do better with energy savings through efficiency initiatives than what Duke proposes to comply with the landmark 2021 state law that mandates the 70% reduction as well as zero-net CO2 emissions by 2050.\\n\\nAccording to a report filed with the commission Wednesday prepared by an outside firm hired by the coalition, the mandates can also be met at a lower cost for customers, who are expected to pay higher bills for these shifts.\\n\\n“Duke’s carbon plan is deeply flawed,” said Luis Martinez, director of Southeast energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups that filed written comments by a deadline last Friday. “But this modeling shows that a less costly plan, which also significantly reduces emissions, is possible for North Carolina.”\\n\\nThe law directs the Utilities Commission to tell Charlotte-based Duke Energy how to meet these reductions by the end of the year, and says the seven-member panel can examine “the latest technological breakthroughs to achieve the least cost path,” among other considerations. The commission is holding in-person hearings this month and online meetings next month to take public comment.\\n\\nDuke spokesperson Bill Norton said Thursday that the utility’s priority remains “to produce the most efficient, reliable, least-cost way to deliver the clean energy our customers deserve and expect” and that Duke looks forward to reviewing proposals and “providing constructive feedback” to the commission.\\n\\nThe coalition, which also includes the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Sierra Club, is also critical of Duke Energy’s plan because it wants four energy-portfolio alterations it proposed approved, not just one. The utility says that would provide more flexibility and time to evaluate emerging electricity sources.\\n\\nAll four portfolios do envision retiring Duke Energy’s remaining coal-fired power plants in North Carolina by 2035. They also would rely on hydroelectric power storage; an emerging form of small nuclear power plants; and additional natural gas-powered plants, which can provide energy on cloudy or high-demand days.\\n\\nNatural gas burns cleaner than coal and is considered a bridge fuel while other alternate energy sources are ramped up. But critics say the methane contained in natural gas and that can leak is disproportionately more damaging to the climate than carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThree of the four portfolios don’t reach the 70% reduction target by 2032 or 2034, but the utility said those plans would result in slightly lower average annual increases on retail power bills through 2035.\\n\\nThe law gives the commission the ability to delay the 2030 target by up to two years, and even longer if regulatory and construction delays for nuclear or wind energy facilities arise, or if the electric grid’s performance is questioned.\\n\\nStill, “the commission has an obligation to develop a plan to achieve the required carbon reduction requirements set forth in law,” the coalition’s written comments say, calling Duke’s proposal a “Choose-Your-Own Adventure Carbon Plan.”\\n\\nThe utility’s plan covers activities in North Carolina and South Carolina, but the 70% reduction only applies to North Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress serve 4.4 million customers in the two states. The coalition said its proposal could trim anticipated higher costs for ratepayers by 2% to 7% through 2030 compared to Duke’s plan.\\n\\nPhoto via Duke Energy.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Biden-Harris Administration, through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), today announced the launch of four programs that will help build a commercially viable, just, and responsible carbon dioxide removal industry in the United States. The programs, funded with $3.7 billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help accelerate private-sector investment, spur advancements in monitoring and reporting practices for carbon management technologies, and provide grants to state and local governments to procure and use products developed from captured carbon emissions. In tandem with strong actions to lower carbon emissions, large-scale deployment of carbon management technologies is crucial to addressing the climate crisis and meeting President Biden’s goal of a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050, which will both protect existing industrial jobs and create new ones.\\n\\n“No matter how fast we decarbonize the nation’s economy, we must tackle the legacy pollution already in our atmosphere to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides the transformative investments needed to scale up the commercial use of technologies that can remove or capture CO2, which will bring jobs to our regions across the country and deliver a healthier environment for all Americans.”\\n\\nThe President’s historic agenda is working to lower carbon pollution across all sectors of our economy. As we continue to lower carbon emissions even further, carbon dioxide removal is a critical tool for cleaning up legacy carbon pollution that is already causing significant climate change related damage in the form of more intense storms, floods, and wildfires.\\n\\nIn addition to this funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act features substantial improvements to the federal Section 45Q tax credit for the capture and geologic storage of CO2, which will provide substantial complementary incentives. DOE’s analysis estimates that actions taken through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will drive 2030 economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 2005 levels.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOE’s efforts will result in benefits to communities across the United States like creating quality jobs, while ensuring projects prioritize equity and environmental justice in alignment with President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to provide 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, these technologies can reduce criteria air pollutants, protect communities from increases in cumulative pollution, and maintain and create good, union-friendly jobs across the country.\\n\\nToday, DOE is announcing new efforts from the following Bipartisan Infrastructure Law:\\n\\nDirect Air Capture Commercial and Pre-Commercial Prize – DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) is announcing the Direct Air Capture Prize for support and prize awards totaling $115 million to promote diverse approaches to direct air capture. The Direct Air Capture Pre-Commercial Prize provides up to $15 million in prizes to incubate and accelerate research and development of breakthrough direct air capture technologies. The Direct Air Capture Commercial Prize provides up to $100 million in prizes to qualified direct air capture facilities for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Read the full Direct Air Capture Prize Competitions announcement here\\n\\nRegional Direct Air Capture Hubs – DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), in partnership with FECM, is announcing the Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. DOE will invest $3.5 billion to develop four domestic regional direct air capture hubs, each of which will demonstrate a direct air capture technology or suite of technologies at commercial scale with the potential for capturing at least 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually from the atmosphere and storing that CO2 permanently in a geologic formation or through its conversion into products. The first funding opportunity announcement under this program released today makes available more than $1.2 billion to begin the process for conceptualizing, designing, planning, constructing, and operating direct air capture hubs, with additional opportunities expected to follow in the coming years. Read the full funding opportunity announcement here\\n\\nCarbon Utilization Procurement Grants – FECM will manage the Carbon Utilization Procurement Grants Program, which will provide grants to states, local governments, and public utilities to support the commercialization of technologies that reduce carbon emissions while also procuring and using commercial or industrial products developed from captured carbon emissions. The Notice of Intent released today informs stakeholders of DOE’s intent to announce the first FOA issuance, which will provide grants totaling up to $100 million. Read the Notice of Intent here\\n\\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF) -– DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions (OTT), in partnership with FECM, will issue a Lab Call to accelerate commercialization of carbon dioxide removal technologies, including direct air capture, by advancing measurement, reporting, and verification best practices and capabilities. OTT anticipates awarding $15 million to projects led by DOE National Laboratories, plants, and sites, and supported by diverse industry partnerships spanning the emerging carbon dioxide removal sector. Visit OTT’s TCF Lab Call webpage here\\n\\nDOE’s Commitment to Carbon Capture Innovation\\n\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs support the goals of DOE’s Carbon Negative Shot initiative, which calls for innovation in carbon dioxide removal pathways that will capture CO2 from the atmosphere and store it at gigaton scales for less than $100/net metric ton of CO2-equivalent. They also contribute to U.S. responsibilities under the Carbon Dioxide Removal Launchpad, a coalition of countries that has committed to leveraging collective resources and best practices to accelerate innovation and cost reductions across a portfolio of carbon dioxide removal technologies. The Carbon Dioxide Removal Launchpad members each agree to build at least one 1,000+ ton/year carbon dioxide removal project by 2025, contribute to cumulative investment of $100 million collectively by 2025 to support demonstration projects, and support efforts to advance robust measurement, reporting, and verification.\\n\\nSince January 2021, DOE has invested more than $250 million in 62 research and development projects and front-end engineering design studies to advance carbon management approaches that include carbon dioxide removal and carbon utilization projects.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit the OCED, FECM, and OTT websites for more information on how DOE is working to expand the commercial impact of its research investments to accelerate the deployment of carbon management technologies and support an equitable transition to a decarbonized energy system.',\n",
       " \"For months, Duke Energy has been defending its carbon-cutting plans for its core Carolinas service territory against critics who say the utility’s energy forecasts deliberately understate how much solar power and battery storage will be available to the grid. Now, the utility is making its case in person to an audience of regulators and skeptical clean-energy advocates.\\n\\nLast week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission began what is expected to be weeks of expert testimony and cross-examination on Duke Energy’s plan to comply with HB 951, the North Carolina law that requires subsidiaries Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to cut carbon emissions by 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\\n\\nSubscribe to receive Canary's latest news\\n\\nDuke is asking the commission to consider four different proposals — only one of which actually aims to meet the 2030 carbon-reduction target rather than pushing it out to 2032 or 2034, and all four of which call for building about 2 gigawatts of new fossil-gas-fired power plants by the end of the decade. Environmental activists, clean energy trade groups, consumer advocates, local governments and the state’s Attorney General’s Office have all rejected Duke’s proposals and submitted their own alternatives to the commission, which they say will not only reduce carbon emissions more quickly but also save money over the long run.\\n\\nThe reason for this, according to Tyler Norris, vice president of development at solar developer Cypress Creek Renewables, is simply that \\u200b“solar and solar-plus-storage are the most affordable, proven and scalable zero-carbon resources available to Duke’s system.”\\n\\nDuke argues that its plans are the safest and most cost-effective option and that the alternative plans are \\u200b“based on flawed and incomplete analysis.” The groups challenging Duke have pushed back, saying that the utility’s lack of transparency about the data and methods that informed its conclusions has left them no option but to create their own plans.\\n\\nUtilities and state regulators across the country face similar challenges as they strive to cut emissions at a pace needed to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Half of the states in the country have set greenhouse-gas reduction targets, and many utilities in states that haven’t set targets have set their own voluntary goals, as Duke did in 2019 with its commitment to hit net zero by 2050.\\n\\nBut Duke, which owns one of the country’s largest and most carbon-intensive generation fleets across multiple states, could play an outsize role in cutting electricity-sector emissions, a key step in decarbonizing transportation, heating and other sectors.\\n\\nThe North Carolina Utilities Commission is required by statute to choose a plan by December 31. To make that decision, its seven members must weigh a staggeringly complex set of variables, from the future costs and availability of emerging technologies such as small modular nuclear reactors and green hydrogen to how much support Duke should provide for energy efficiency, demand response and rooftop solar.\\n\\nBut amidst a sprawling and long-running debate over North Carolina’s clean energy future, the biggest point of contention in the near term is whether Duke Energy is intentionally downplaying the role that utility-scale solar and batteries can play in its transition to a low-carbon grid.\\n\\nCaps on adding new solar: A major sticking point\\n\\nDuke’s critics believe that the utility is doing just that. One of the many complaints they’ve raised involves the utility’s approach to modeling a cost-effective future grid mix — in particular, its decision to insert a cap on how much new solar its computer models could select between 2026 and 2030: a limit of 750 megawatts in 2026, 1,050 megawatts in 2027 and 1,350 megawatts per year from 2028 onward.\\n\\nThat’s a critical limitation on modeling that should be used to inform how the utility and regulators can best balance the priorities of reducing carbon emissions, maintaining reliable grid service and minimizing the rate increases customers will bear to pay for it all.\\n\\nA study by Synapse Energy Economics commissioned by groups including the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club found that a more solar-heavy portfolio could save $700 million by 2030 compared to Duke’s plan while maintaining reliable electricity supplies. Expanding access to wind power from the Midwest — something outside the scope of Duke’s plans — could bring much greater savings, the analysis found.\\n\\n“We’re advocating for a plan that successfully achieves the 2030 mandate of 70 percent carbon reduction in a way that has minimal impact for ratepayers,” said Matt Abele, the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association’s marketing and communications director.\\n\\nA study by The Brattle Group commissioned by the Clean Power Suppliers Association trade group found similar results. Allowing models to select solar beyond Duke’s caps adds 7,500 megawatts of solar by 2030, compared to Duke’s 5,175 megawatts. This reduces the total annual system costs of the portfolio by $860 million in 2030, $730 million in 2032 and $690 million in 2035, for cumulative savings amounting to billions of dollars.\\n\\nBrattle Group’s modeling shows that Duke Energy could dramatically increase how much solar it can add to its grid. (Brattle Group)\\n\\nDuke will have opportunities to refine its longer-term plans with the commission in the years ahead, Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy Carolinas’ vice president of regulatory affairs and policy, said during the first day of hearings on September 13. At the same time, \\u200b“we’re asking for a suite of near-term procurement decisions and actions” to set the stage for building what’s needed in the years between now and 2030, she added.\\n\\nCapping the amount of solar and solar-plus-battery systems that can be added between now and 2030 affects those near-term plans, most notably by leaving a hole in Duke’s generation portfolio that must be filled as Duke closes down its Carolinas coal plants by 2030 — a hole that Duke plans to fill with fossil gas.\\n\\nThat’s why \\u200b“there’s arguably no single modeling assumption in dispute in this proceeding with greater implications than the solar interconnection constraint,” Cypress Creek Renewables’ Norris said in an email. \\u200b“Duke’s proposed solar cap [will] make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve North Carolina’s CO 2 reduction goal by 2030, while significantly increasing compliance costs and forcing reliance on more expensive technologies.”\\n\\nConflicts over modeling\\n\\nDuke claims that moving more quickly to cut carbon will raise costs for customers. According to its carbon plan, Portfolio 1 — the only scenario that achieves a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 — will cost $2 billion more than its Portfolio 2 option, which delays hitting the 70 percent target until 2032, and $6 billion more than Portfolios 3 and 4, which don’t reach the target until 2034.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuke Energy’s four initial Carbon Plan portfolios (Duke Energy)\\n\\nElectricity prices are important to all customers, and we’re doing all that we can to keep these rates affordable,” Bowman said in last week’s testimony.\\n\\nBut the North Carolina Utilities Commission has already ordered Duke to revise some of its modeling after critics pointed out flaws earlier this summer. Tyler Fitch, a senior associate with Synapse Energy Economics, noted in his testimony to the commission that Duke manually overrode its initial modeling in ways that replaced about 1 gigawatt of battery storage capacity with gas-fired combustion turbines in its 2035 models, and replaced an even greater amount of batteries with gas and nuclear power by 2050 (see chart below).\\n\\nSynapse Energy Economics says that Duke Energy manually manipulated its Carbon Plan modeling to replace battery storage with gas and nuclear power. (Synapse Energy Economics)\\n\\nTo comply with the commission’s request, Duke filed two supplemental portfolios in late July. Those portfolios include changes welcomed by some critics, such as revising how batteries and solar-battery systems are modeled so they charge with lower-cost energy and discharge when energy prices are higher, increasing their economic value.\\n\\nBut the two supplemental portfolios don’t lift the caps on solar deployments from 2026 to 2030. Earlier this month, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein weighed in, asking the commission to reject Duke’s plan and to decline any proposals from Duke to streamline permitting new gas plants before \\u200b“no-regrets” solar, battery and onshore wind deployments can be pursued.\",\n",
       " 'In the race to decarbonize our companies, we’re rewriting the road signs as we drive. When buying renewable energy, different approaches call for different avenues of action, but in 2022, a renewed focus on more precise and systemic decarbonization has begun. We’ve outgrown the system that got us here, and carbon-free energy procurement is emerging as the next platform for corporate leadership.\\n\\nIn the context of procurement, carbon-free energy describes any energy bought that was produced by a resource that generates no carbon emissions.\\n\\nCarbon-free energy is where we know we need to be, but first the industry has to make its way through the scrum to define the best path forward. Fundamental questions remain, all the way down to choosing the metrics to measure progress — whether that’s expressed in emissions reductions or the addition of carbon-free megawatt-hours of electricity. Whatever the outcomes, those performance indicators will be central to defining the next generation of energy procurement.\\n\\n24/7 carbon-free energy\\n\\nYou can think about 24/7 carbon-free energy as a sharper focus on improving the grid’s generation and transmission capacity to get clean electrons through the grid to the buyer any time they need it.\\n\\nGoogle is pioneering this approach. \"It’s best not to think of 24/7 energy as a procurement strategy but an approach to transforming the system and enabling a decarbonized grid for everyone,\" said Sarah Penndorf, standards and advocacy lead for Google, during a session at VERGE 22 last month.\\n\\nThose pursuing 24/7-driven procurement strategies say their own emissions aren\\'t the end goal — they’re seeking decarbonization of the entire grid. The fact is that while buying renewable energy through corporate power purchase agreements or other mechanisms might get companies’ carbon accounting to zero emissions or help them reach annual energy matching goals, that practice doesn’t necessarily lead to actually decarbonizing the company or the grid.\\n\\nIn contrast, by focusing on the 24/7 goal, corporate energy buyers can funnel direct investment toward the numerous technologies that are left in the gap between wind and solar, catalyzing wider spread adoption of these new innovations for everyone. This is because the 24/7 approach includes technologies that don’t qualify for renewable energy credits (RECs) such as nuclear and hydropower as well as battery storage. Under a 24/7 approach, companies would first focus on decarbonizing the energy infrastructure nearest to them, then wherever the rest of their energy comes from — and also pressure their utilities, regulators and policymakers about the lack of 24/7 options.\\n\\nGoogle has partnered with C40 Cities, a global network of mayors taking urgent action to confront the climate crisis, to bring city governments into the conversation, starting with London, Copenhagen and Paris. The collaboration will provide insights and resources to help these cities take advantage of their enormous buying power and leverage in revamping their energy infrastructure.\\n\\n[Catch up on all of our coverage of VERGE 22.]\\n\\nThe Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) is an organization that understands the monumental task at hand, and after speaking with Bryn Baker, a senior director of marketing and policy innovation for CEBA and moderator of VERGE’s panel, the challenges were clear: 24/7 is tricky, visionary, highly impactful and can be expensive, she told me. Larger corporations and institutional buyers are more suited to tackling their energy grid head on, but for small and midsize companies with smaller budgets and teams, it can be overwhelming to try to decarbonize your energy consumption, Baker said.\\n\\nCounting emissions that were never released\\n\\nCurrently, smaller businesses\\' primary way to engage in carbon-free energy is through procuring energy attribute certificates (EACs). Companies buy an EAC, representing one MWh of renewable energy. Once it’s used, the credit is retired and can be reported in a company’s Scope 2 or 3 emissions as carbon savings. This approach offers the lowest cost per ton for companies to reduce emissions and provides an avenue for everyone, no matter their buying power, to engage in carbon reductions.\\n\\nThe panel discussed how despite skepticism about the real impact of RECs — the main EAC you can buy in the United States — they can provide an on-ramp to learning about carbon-free energy and have been instrumental for corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs). Since it’s impossible to track a single electron through the power system, we’ve relied on RECs as means to represent them.\\n\\nFor more impactful procurement, companies must get credit for avoided emissions — carbon that never had to be released. For example, if a company buys energy from a renewable energy plant on a grid where the rest of the energy comes from coal, it is making sure carbon-free electricity is used instead of more coal power.\\n\\nFor example, according to WattTime, a nonprofit automating emissions reductions and renewable energy siting, supporting a solar project in West Virginia would avoid three times the emissions as the same-sized project in California — simply because of the makeup of the grid.\\n\\nThese findings led WattTime to coin the term \"emissionality,\" a portmanteau of \"emissions\" and \"additionality.\" That phrase suggests buyers will need to think differently and focus on the creation of more robust EACs that better measure the impact of buying PPAs in the dirtiest grids.\\n\\nVERGE 22 panelist Dennis Carlberg, associate vice president for university sustainability at Boston University, highlighted how the university’s demand of 205,000 megawatt hours a year — compared to Google\\'s more than 9 million — meant Boston University \"had a different need and wasn’t convinced the 24/7 metric would work for their university.\" He said that the university set a goal \"to maximize the university’s investment to achieve the most amount of carbon reductions possible without raising tuition, as quickly as it could.\"\\n\\nAfter months of analysis with internal and external stakeholders, Boston University concluded the largest impact it could achieve was matching 100 percent of its energy for the next 15 years, through a PPA not from the nearby grid in New England but from a wind farm soon to be built in South Dakota.\\n\\nOrganizations such as Boston University are left to create their own approaches to measuring impact, leading to inconsistencies across procurement methodologies. The panel illustrated how there’s much more that must be agreed upon before creating a standardized way to measure avoided emissions, starting with defining what makes a dirty grid and what counts as \"cleaning it up.\"\\n\\nStandardizing the calculations would unlock a critical new level of detail and validity for RECs and the ability for companies to truly measure their carbon impact, the panelists suggested. Carbon emissions counters such as WattTime and EnergyTag, a nonprofit building a market for hourly energy certificates, are both developing formulas for the best approximation. To be able to quantify either methodology, whether that be emissionality or 24/7, we need better data.\\n\\nImage via Shutterstock/Sunshine Studio\\n\\nThe data needed to take the next step\\n\\nThe current generation of carbon-free energy buyers lacks the data to truly drive impact. Currently, companies commonly receive their emissions on an annual basis, despite the carbon intensity of the grid changing by the second.\\n\\nOn top of that, grid operators also have limited visibility into the exploding amounts of distributed energy resources coming onto the grid. This adds more producers and local options, which further complicates the ability to track emissions.\\n\\nThe granularity can go further to include hourly timestamps, real-time carbon intensities and the locations where the electricity is produced. These \"allow us to have an attribution system that recognizes new benefits. It starts with the timestamp, but there might be environmental justice benefits or supplying energy to disadvantaged communities or tribal lands,\" explained Zach Livingston of Cleartrace, an organization creating new methods for how decarbonization information is collected and transacted.\\n\\nRenewable procurement company LevelTen Energy and nonprofit Nature Conservancy are pursuing something similar, releasing a white paper on quantifying a community approach to procurement. Salesforce is developing a procurement matrix that could allow companies to choose to procure energy depending on their land usage or impacts on wildlife.\\n\\nThe real impact is in finding the right combination of 24/7 energy and emissionality that makes sense for each individual company. Like all avenues for action in climate, we need both. CEBA’s Baker closed the session by encouraging attendees to ask how their organization can drive a larger impact — by embracing the full suite of procurement options for driving true grid decarbonization and pursuing other kinds of leadership, including policy, regulatory or utility engagement. No matter which nexus we find ourselves in, carbon-free energy procurement is the clear next step for companies to take in tackling the climate crisis.',\n",

The two programs – the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program and the Carbon Dioxide Transport/Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) Program – are funded by a more than $2.6 billion investment from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Together, the programs build on the Administration’s recent actions to catalyze investments in clean energy and industrial innovation and advance President Biden’s goal of a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050—creating good paying jobs and economic opportunity. The investments also support the Justice40 Initiative, and DOE continues to prioritize engaging with environmental justice communities to ensure that equity is at the center of reaching our climate goals.\\n\\n“To meet President Biden’s climate goals, we have to rapidly decarbonize our power generation and heavy industries – such as steel production – that are essential to the clean energy transition,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law enables DOE to invest in carbon capture, conversion and storage technologies that play essential roles in the development and deployment of clean energy.”\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions, of which CO2 is the primary component, have risen dramatically over the past several decades. Greenhouse gases fuel climate change, increasing the risk of droughts and floods, and putting our agriculture, health, and water supply at risk.

       " \"Global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to massively increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to analysis by the world’s leading energy organisation.\\n\\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy.\\n\\nThe invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world.\\n\\nGovernments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world’s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries – including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss – have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices.\\n\\nHowever, Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion “is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition”.\\n\\nThe IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that – for the first time – government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU’s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India.\\n\\nQ&A Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? Show China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\\n\\nUnder the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (£1.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world.\\n\\nThe IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown.\\n\\nThe analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating.\\n\\nThe wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a “much diminished role in international energy affairs” as the world’s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added.\\n\\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New oil and gas extraction projects “will jeopardise our climate goals”, he said.\\n\\nHe also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was “hiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia”. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices.\\n\\n“None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Birol said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.”\",\n",

       " 'Following Governor Newsom’s call for more ambitious climate action, state’s climate plan would create 4 million new jobs, slash greenhouse gas emissions by 85%, and cut oil usage by 94%\\n\\nAmid global climate talks, the Scoping Plan lays out world’s first detailed pathway to carbon neutrality by 2045, as signed into law by Governor Newsom earlier this year\\n\\nToday, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released its updated proposal to implement the most ambitious climate action of any jurisdiction in the world, taking unprecedented steps to drastically slash pollution and accelerate the transition to clean energy. No economy in the world, much less the soon-to-be 4th largest, has put forth such a comprehensive roadmap to reach carbon neutrality.\\n\\nThis updated plan follows Governor Gavin Newsom’s push to move faster to achieve new, ambitious climate goals, setting new targets for renewable energy, clean buildings, carbon removal, and clean fuels in the transportation sector. If adopted by CARB, this plan will be a critical component of Governor Newsom’s California Climate Commitment – a set of world-leading actions to build out a 100% clean energy grid, achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, ramp up carbon removal and sequestration, protect Californians from harmful oil drilling, and invest $54 billion to forge an oil-free future while building sustainable communities throughout the state.\\n\\nThe updated Scoping Plan would achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, in addition to:\\n\\nCutting air pollution by 71%;\\n\\nSlashing greenhouse gas emissions 85% by 2045; That includes a 48% reduction of greenhouse gasses by 2030, surpassing the statutory mandate to reduce emissions 40% below 1990 levels in 2030;\\n\\nReducing fossil fuel consumption to less than one-tenth of what we use today, a 94% drop in demand for oil and 86% drop in demand for all fossil fuels;\\n\\nCreating 4 million new jobs;\\n\\nSaving Californians $200 billion in health costs due to pollution.\\n\\n“California is drastically cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and cleaning our air – this plan is a comprehensive roadmap to achieve a pollution-free future,” said Governor Newsom. “It’s the most ambitious set of climate goals of any jurisdiction in the world, and if adopted, it’ll spur an economic transformation akin to the industrial revolution. While big polluters focus on increasing their profits at our expense, California is protecting communities, creating jobs and accelerating our transition to clean energy.”\\n\\nThe plan would also raise the stakes for clean energy and climate resiliency, calling for:\\n\\nAt least 20 GW offshore wind capacity built by 2045;\\n\\n3 million climate-friendly homes by 2030 and 7 million by 2035;\\n\\n6 million heat pumps deployed by 2030;\\n\\nCarbon removal/capture targets of 20 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) by 2030 and 100 MMTCO2e by 2045;\\n\\nAchieve 20% non-combustion in the aviation sector by 2045, with the remaining demand met with sustainable aviation fuel;\\n\\nLight-duty vehicle miles traveled (VMT) target of 25% per capita below 1990 levels by 2030 and 30% per capita below 1990 levels by 2045.\\n\\nToday’s release follows the latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory, showing that 2020 had the steepest recorded drop in pollution in California history due to the pandemic, and including updated data showing California reached its 2020 climate targets six years ahead of schedule in 2014 rather than the initially estimated four.\\n\\nThroughout California, leaders from the environmental, clean energy, academic, labor, and business communities have weighed in on the proposal:\\n\\n“Finally there is a climate action plan that has the potential to bend the warming curve in time. The plan contains all of the essential ingredients of climate resilience: fossil free energy generation; reduction of short lived super pollutants; air pollution abatement; climate justice; restoration of nature’s role as carbon sink. It integrates effortlessly mitigation, adaptation and transformation. This is the new way to address the climate crisis. The health benefits of these actions alone will pay for the huge investment by the state. Having worked on climate change science since 1975, I am finally seeing a climate solutions plan that recognizes the grave risks posed by the climate crisis; I hope the rest of the planet will follow the California example.” – V. Ram Ramanathan, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, University of California at San Diego\\n\\n“The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world must rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions in the current decade. Governor Newsom understands the importance of near-term ambition, and his Administration is to be commended for delivering a Scoping Plan that exceeds California’s 2030 emissions reduction goal while providing necessary air quality and public health benefits for all Californians. EDF looks forward to working with the Air Resources Board and partner agencies to adopt policy in the coming year – including a more ambitious emissions cap – that locks in these necessary reductions.” – Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California State Director, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)\\n\\n“We stand ready to partner with the Governor on implementing this ambitious plan while growing living-wage clean energy jobs. IBEW’s close partnership with the state will help California lead the world in building a clean energy future for decades to come.” – Joel Barton, Secretary Treasurer of the State Association of Electrical Workers\\n\\n“The Yurok Tribe applauds CARB for establishing a progressive Scoping Plan to implement the state’s climate goals. We especially appreciate efforts to include Tribal voices in the development of the plan. We now look forward to moving to implementation of the plan in the years ahead.” – Chairman James, The Yurok Tribe\\n\\n“The Scoping Plan contains many ambitious goals that will create major benefits for California and the world if we succeed in reaching them. But until we take action, it is just a report. It is our job as an advocacy community to turn seemingly impossible goals into realities and to prevent outcomes that continue the legacy of environmental racism at the hands of polluting fossil fuel companies. NextGen stands ready to work with the State to build a California that we can all be proud of.” – David Weiskopf, Senior Policy Advisor, NextGen Policy\\n\\n“We have an urgent call to action and unless we act decisively, many of our communities will continue to experience severe impacts of a worsening climate. We know smart land management across California is essential to every region in the state. To advance a healthier and thriving California, we must double down on our efforts to accelerate nature-based climate solutions that increase access to nature and protect our public health. The Trust for Public Land, in partnership with the State of California, is ready to advance and deliver on this agenda.” – Juan Altamirano, Director of Government Affairs, Trust for Public Land\\n\\n“The California Hydrogen Coalition supports the Scoping Plan’s bold framework of action that is inclusive of clean and renewable hydrogen. Paired with Governor Newsom’s and the Legislature’s creation of ARCHES to leverage federal funding opportunities, the Scoping Plan supports hydrogen as a mitigation tool for short-lived but potent methane emissions and the management of biomass without combustion in addition to enabling deeper penetration of renewable electricity by providing greater grid resiliency and reliability. Decarbonized and renewable hydrogen in fuel cells for zero-emission transportation, transit, goods movement, industrial activities, and power will enable California to cost-effectively achieve carbon neutrality. We look forward to CARB adopting the Scoping Plan.” – Teresa Cooke, Executive Director, California Hydrogen Coalition\\n\\n“Nothing could be more important to community resilience, improved air quality, public health, and economic prosperity in the rural regions of the state than the 2022 Scoping Plan proposal to conserve 30% of the California’s natural and working lands by 2030 and treat more than 2 million acres a year to reduce the risk of wildfire and capture carbon in our soils. This strategy will drive innovation in rural regions and create thousands of good jobs in rural communities.” – Steve Frisch, President, Sierra Business Council\\n\\n“The landmark ambition of the Scoping Plan and 2022 legislative actions sets California on a course to build energy, transportation, and decarbonization infrastructure that will rival the new deal in terms of scale. Ambition demands action – CCEEB’s membership is ready to build the necessary infrastructure to achieve our shared climate goals. We will work diligently with the Governor, Legislature, local governments, and CARB to permit and build a carbon neutral future for all Californians with strong economic and labor protections that support a thriving middle class.” – Tim Carmichael, President and CEO, California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance (CCEEB)\\n\\n“The Los Angeles Business Council commends CARB for crafting a Scoping Plan that will allow the state to meet its necessary climate targets, while creating clear guidelines for industry to follow. The Scoping Plan lays out a crucial roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 and 100% zero emission vehicle sales by 2035 that are critical to climate, public health, and economic goals. California has proven time and time again that science-based public policy can and will reduce the adverse impacts of climate change, improve health outcomes for Californians, and spur in-state investment and job creation that has allowed California to be the number one clean energy job creator in the nation.” – Mary Leslie, President, Los Angeles Business Council\\n\\n“PG&E commends CARB for its robust public process to develop the Scoping Plan. It establishes the right framework to achieve the Governor’s and the State’s ambitious climate goals, while minimizing costs to customers. The Plan allows for a wide range of decarbonization strategies, and will help deliver carbon neutrality through significant economy-wide emissions reductions and carbon removal.

       " 'Energy transition pathways\\n\\nFourteen 1.5 °C–consistent (RCP1.9) mitigation pathways were selected for this study. For illustrative purposes, we focus on four pathways (LED, S1-A, S2-M, and S5-R) from the IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, which the IPCC selected as illustrative archetypes of alternative low-carbon transitions1. These transitions are model interpretations of four distinct narratives that describe possible socioeconomic and technological developments in a world that limits climate change to 1.5 °C. The narratives are: Low Energy Demand (LED)31, Sustainability (S1)58, Middle of the Road (S2)59, and Fossil-fuelled Development (S5)60.\\n\\nTo capture a wider range of assumptions and modelling frameworks beyond the four illustrative pathways, we complement the analysis with ten additional pathways, which were produced in the same study as S1-A, S2-M, and S5-R by Rogelj et al.30. Five of these are modelling representations of S1, three of S2, and one each of S4 and S5. S4 is also known as the “world of deepening inequality” narrative61.\\n\\nEnergy requirements and EROI\\n\\nWe estimate the energy for the energy system during transition by applying the analytical framework of Energy Return on Investment (EROI) at the final energy stage. EROI describes a ratio between the amount of net energy delivered to society (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NET}}}}}}}}\\\\)) and the total amount of energy that is required to extract, convert, and deliver this energy (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}\\\\)), which we also refer to as the energy for the energy system23,62. EROI is a measure of energy system efficiency, as it compares the amount of energy that enters the productive economy with the energy that is associated with total (gross) energy production14,63. The lower the EROI, the greater the energy requirements, and the lower the net energy that is available for productive socioeconomic activities (see Eq. 1).\\n\\n$${{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NET}}}}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}}\\\\,=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GROSS}}}}}}}}-{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}}=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GROSS}}}}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}}-1$$ (1)\\n\\nWe define the system boundaries of our EROI analysis at the final energy boundary, also known as the point-of-use boundary, which describes the point where energy carriers enter the productive economy64. EROI FIN includes all of the direct inputs along the energy supply chain required to extract (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}}}\\\\)) and refine energy resources (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}\\\\)), the energy used to transport the energy from the primary energy stage to the point of use for society (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}\\\\)), as well as the energy requirements associated with construction (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}\\\\)), decommissioning (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}}}\\\\)), and operation and maintenance of energy infrastructure (\\\\({E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O\\\\&M}}}}}}}\\\\)), such as power plants and refineries, as shown in Eq. 224:\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}}}={E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}}}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}+{E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\rm{\\\\&}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\mathrm{M}}}}}}}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}}}$$ (2)\\n\\nEnergy for construction refers to the energy that is used to manufacture and build energy infrastructure like power plants and refineries. Energy for decommissioning accounts for the energy required to dismantle, remove, and dispose of obsolete energy infrastructure. Energy for operation and maintenance includes energy used to extract primary energy resources, and the energy required to convert primary energy into useful energy carriers and deliver them to the end-user. Energy for operation and maintenance also includes all of the energy inputs for the energy industry’s own use, from the primary to the final energy stage.\\n\\nBy convention, energy conversion losses from primary to final energy and energy losses in distribution, transmission, and storage (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{LOSS}}}}}}}}\\\\)) are not counted among the energy requirements of energy conversion technologies10. These losses are already accounted for in the energy balances of the original data from the pathways and result in lower final energy relative to total energy generation. Moreover, the energy requirements do not include the raw energy embodied in energy resources (e.g. the heating value of gas) that are to be converted into useful carriers. The energy requirements only account for energy inputs that are needed to procure and process the resources into useful energy carriers, and to deliver these carriers to the end-user. See Supplementary Fig. 7 for a complete illustration of our energy system boundaries and the representation of energy flows from primary energy sources to net energy.\\n\\nWe estimate the energy requirements for twenty-seven energy conversion technologies that are represented in the mitigation pathways (see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for a detailed overview of all energy conversion technologies in our model). These technologies describe different pathways of energy conversion from fossil fuels and biomass alongside energy generated from non-biomass renewables, nuclear energy, and hydrogen. In our calculations of energy for the energy system, we distinguish between four types of energy carriers that are represented in the mitigation pathways: electricity, refined liquid fuels, gases, and solids (coal and combustible biomass).\\n\\nEnergy requirements of fossil fuel and biomass technologies\\n\\nFor energy conversion from fossil fuels and biomass, the main energy requirements are associated with the extraction, processing, and delivery of energy resources, whereas the construction, decommissioning, and operation and maintenance of the energy infrastructure represent only a small share of total energy requirements25. By contrast, for non-biomass renewables, almost all energy requirements are from upfront energy demand for the construction of energy infrastructure.\\n\\nWe estimate the energy requirements associated with construction as upfront energy invested during the first year of the energy facility’s lifetime. Similarly, the energy required for decommissioning is accounted for at the end of the energy infrastructure lifetime. The remaining energy inputs that are associated with energy system operations are counted every year during the lifetime of the energy infrastructure.\\n\\nTo calculate the energy requirements to build, decommission, and operate and maintain the energy infrastructure, we follow the previous work of Sgouridis et al.65. We calculate the energy required for the construction and the energy embodied in the energy generation machinery by estimating the energy intensity of capital (\\\\(\\\\varepsilon\\\\)) and multiplying it first by the capital costs of infrastructure per unit of installed power (\\\\({C}_{p}\\\\)), and second by the newly installed power capacity in the respective year (\\\\({P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}\\\\)), as shown in Eq. 3. For infrastructure capital costs, we use values from the REMIND IAM documentation66, which are provided in $US2015. We estimate the energy intensity of capital at 4.52 TJ/million $US2015, after adjusting for inflation the estimate of 5.49 TJ per million $US2007 from the abovementioned study, using the producer price index from the PCU3336 industry group data67. Values of the parameters for different energy conversion technologies are listed in Supplementary Table 10.\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}(t)=\\\\varepsilon \\\\times {C}_{p}\\\\times {P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}(t)$$ (3)\\n\\nIn our calculations of energy requirements associated with new energy infrastructure, we include the power capacity built to increase energy production as well as the capacity that replaces the infrastructure that is decommissioned at the end of its lifetime (\\\\(\\\\tau\\\\)), as shown in Eq. 4:\\n\\n$${P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{c}{\\\\max }\\\\left(0,\\\\,P\\\\left(t\\\\right)-P\\\\left(t-1\\\\right)\\\\right){{{{{\\\\rm{;}}}}}}\\\\,t\\\\, < \\\\,\\\\tau \\\\\\\\ {\\\\max }\\\\left(0,\\\\,P\\\\left(t\\\\right)-P\\\\left(t-1\\\\right)+{P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}(t-\\\\tau )\\\\right){{{{{\\\\rm{;}}}}}}\\\\,t\\\\ge \\\\tau \\\\end{array}\\\\right.$$ (4)\\n\\nWe calculate the energy for the operation and maintenance of energy infrastructure as a product of the energy intensity of capital and the operation and maintenance costs per unit of generated energy (\\\\({C}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{O}}}}\\\\&{{{\\\\mathrm{M}}}}}}}}\\\\)) multiplied by the total energy generated per year (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GEN}}}}}}}}\\\\)), as shown in Eq. 5:\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\rm{\\\\&}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\mathrm{M}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\varepsilon \\\\times {C}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\rm{\\\\&}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\mathrm{M}}}}}}}\\\\times {E}_{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{GEN}}}}}}}}(t)$$ (5)\\n\\nIn estimating the energy required for the decommissioning of energy infrastructure at the end of its life we apply the assumption of Hertwich et al.35, who estimates that decommissioning represents roughly 10% of the energy required for construction (see Eq. 6).\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}}}(t)=0.1\\\\times {E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}(t-\\\\tau )$$ (6)\\n\\nIn the following steps, we describe the calculation of the energy requirements of processes for obtaining raw fuels before they are refined into useful energy carriers that can be delivered to end-users.\\n\\nTo estimate the energy used in the extraction, mining, or harvesting of raw fuels, we collect a series of present-day EROI estimates at the standard energy system boundary28 (e.g. farm-gate or mine-mouth; denoted EROI ST ) from the peer-reviewed literature, as listed in Supplementary Table 11. From the EROI ST values of these selected studies, we calculate the lower, median, and upper inter-quartile range of the EROI ST for each energy resource and use these values to determine a range of estimated energy requirements associated with the appropriation of raw energy fuels. We assume the EROI ST of fossil fuels will continue to decline over time. We model the decline by following the approach of Dale et al.29 and Sgouridis et al.5, who use the equation of exponential decline from present-day values EROI ST (0) shown in Eq. 7. This approach models the convergence of EROI ST towards the minimum EROI (EROI ST,low ), which we assume corresponds to the lower inter-quartile range of present-day EROI estimates. The rate of decline (\\\\({\\\\beta }_{C}\\\\)) for each respective resource is calibrated from the historical trend for the EROI ST of fossil fuels, as published by Brockway et al.14.\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)={{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}},{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{low}}}}}}}}+({{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}}}\\\\left(0\\\\right)-{{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}},{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{low}}}}}}}})\\\\times {exp}^{-{\\\\beta }_{C}\\\\times t}$$ (7)\\n\\nEROI ST compares the raw energy content of energy resources such as wood, coal, gas, and crude oil (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{RAW}}}}}}}}\\\\)) with the energy required to obtain these fuels (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}}}\\\\); see Eq. 8), before they are converted into useful energy carriers. The efficiency of energy conversion (\\\\({{{\\\\eta }}}_{C}\\\\)) depends on the respective energy conversion technology and may change over time. In this study, we apply the energy conversion coefficients from the representation of energy technologies in the REMIND model66,68. The model assumes energy conversion efficiency in new energy infrastructure improves over time. We combine Eq. 8 and 9 to obtain an expression that links the energy requirements of extraction (or harvest or mining) to the efficiency of energy conversion and EROI ST (Eq. 10).\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{RAW}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)}{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)}$$ (8)\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GEN}}}}}}}}(t)={\\\\eta }_{C}(t)\\\\times {E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{RAW}}}}}}}}(t)$$ (9)\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}}}(t)=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GEN}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)}{{{\\\\eta }_{C}(t)\\\\times {{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{ST}}}}}}}}}}$$ (10)\\n\\nIn estimating the energy required for the refining or processing of fuels (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}\\\\)) we refer to the calculations from previous studies. For the refining of crude oil, we use the estimates of energy intensity of refining in MJ per kg (\\\\({\\\\mu }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}\\\\)) from Raugei and Leccisi63 and the “Ecoinvent Life-cycle Inventories of Oil Refinery Processing”69. For the processing of raw fuels from biomass, we use estimates of energy intensity from an extensive literature review by Fajardy et al.36,37. We define the energy used in refining as a product of the mass of the respective fuel and the energy intensity of refining, as shown in Eq. 11. We calculate the mass of the fuel by dividing the raw energy content of energy resources (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{RAW}}}}}}}}\\\\)) by the higher heating value (\\\\({{{{{\\\\rm{HHV}}}}}}\\\\)), described by Eq. 12. We do not assume specific energy requirements for the processing of natural gas and coal, consistent with previous EROI and life-cycle studies63,70.\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}(t)={M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}}}(t){\\\\times \\\\mu }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}}}$$ (11)\\n\\n$${M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{RAW}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)}{{{{{{\\\\rm{HHV}}}}}}}$$ (12)\\n\\nTo calculate the energy requirements for transportation, we assess global trade routes of coal, gas, and crude oil in the year 2019, by using the flows of these fuels from the international trade balance sheets of the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2020. For biomass, we use data on the global flows of wood pellets from Junginger et al.71. We partition the trade routes (indexed with l) into different stages by transportation type, estimating the average trade distance in each route. For example, the oil route from Baghdad (Iraq) to Houston (USA) consists of an onshore pipeline of 970 km from Baghdad to Ceyhan (Turkey), a sea freight route of 12,500 km from Ceyhan to Houston, and an onshore pipeline of 100 km on the US mainland. We assume that the energy intensities of fuel transportation types remain constant over time.\\n\\nWe calculate the energy used in each stage of transportation (indexed with j) by multiplying the amount of fuel transported by the energy intensity of the transportation type and the distance over which the fuel is transported, as shown in Eq. 13. The parameters for the transportation types are obtained from the life-cycle inventory database EcoInvent v3.272, and can be found among the parameters listed in Supplementary Table 10.\\n\\n$${M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}},l}\\\\times {\\\\gamma }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}},j}\\\\times {{{{{{\\\\rm{distance}}}}}}}_{l,j}$$ (13)\\n\\nTo estimate the average global energy intensity (\\\\({\\\\epsilon }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}\\\\)) associated with the transportation of each fuel (in MJ/kg), we sum the energy use across the global trade routes and divide the sum by the global volume of trade flows (in tonne kilometres), defined as the global sum of transported fuel multiplied by the distance, as described in Eq. 14:\\n\\n$${\\\\epsilon }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{l}\\\\left({M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}},l}\\\\times \\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{j}{\\\\gamma }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}},j}\\\\times {{{{{{\\\\rm{distance}}}}}}}_{l,j}\\\\right)}{\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{l}\\\\left({M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}},l}\\\\times \\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{j}{{{{{{\\\\rm{distance}}}}}}}_{l,j}\\\\right)}$$ (14)\\n\\nFinally, we obtain the energy required for the transportation of raw fuel by multiplying the mass of the fuel transported by the average global energy intensity of fuel transportation for each respective fuel, as shown in Eq. 15:\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)={M}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{FUEL}}}}}}}}(t){\\\\times \\\\epsilon }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}}}$$ (15)\\n\\nFor a complete overview of our assumptions regarding the trade routes of coal, natural gas, crude oil, and biomass, and our calculations of the energy intensities of fuel transport, see Supplementary Tables 12–15.\\n\\nEnergy requirements of non-biomass renewables and nuclear energy\\n\\nThe largest energy requirements of non-biomass renewables (i.e. solar photovoltaics, wind, geothermal, and hydropower) are related to the manufacturing and construction of energy infrastructure25,35. For renewables, the energy required for operation is much lower than technologies that produce energy from raw fossil fuels, as renewable sources do not require energy to be extracted, transported, and processed. For nuclear energy, the energy to maintain the energy supply chain also includes energy requirements for the extraction, enrichment, and transportation of uranium. Here, the energy requirements for operating energy infrastructure and maintaining the energy supply are substantially higher compared to the construction of energy infrastructure.\\n\\nTo obtain estimates of the energy requirements of renewables and nuclear energy over the lifetime of each technology, we collected a series of present-day EROI estimates for each technology at the final energy boundary, from a number of peer-reviewed studies (see the studies listed in Supplementary Table 1). From these studies, we calculated the lower, median, and upper quartiles of the range of EROI values for each energy source. These quartiles are classified as low, median, and high-EROI estimates.\\n\\nWe divided the energy requirements between the energy required for construction (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}\\\\)) and decommissioning (\\\\({E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}}}\\\\)) of the energy infrastructure, and the annual energy requirements to operate the energy infrastructure and maintain the energy supply (\\\\({E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O\\\\&M}}}}}}}\\\\)), following the approach of King and van den Bergh12. Energy requirements for operation are proportional to the total installed power (\\\\(P\\\\)) times the capacity factor (\\\\({{{{{\\\\rm{CF}}}}}}\\\\)) divided by the EROI of the technology12, as shown in Eq. 16. CF is a dimensionless ratio that compares the actual annual generation of energy to the maximum potential energy output. The parameter \\\\({\\\\alpha }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{tech}}}}}}}}\\\\) describes the ratio between the energy requirements of operation and the energy invested in construction over the lifetime of the technology.\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O}}}}}}{{\\\\&}}{{{{\\\\mathrm{{M}}}}}}}(t)=\\\\frac{{\\\\alpha }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{tech}}}}}}}}\\\\times P(t)\\\\times {{{{{\\\\rm{CF}}}}}}(t)}{{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}(t)}$$ (16)\\n\\nAs described in Eq. 17, the energy requirements of construction are proportional to newly installed power (\\\\({P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}\\\\)), times the capacity factor of the respective energy conversion technology (\\\\({{{{{\\\\rm{CF}}}}}}\\\\)), multiplied by the lifetime of the technology (τ), and divided by the technology’s EROI.\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}(t)=\\\\frac{(1-{\\\\alpha }_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{tech}}}}}}}})\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,{P}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{NEW}}}}}}}}\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,{{{{{\\\\rm{CF}}}}}}\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,\\\\tau }{{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}(t)}$$ (17)\\n\\nEnergy associated with decommissioning is assumed to represent 10% of the energy used for construction, following Hertwich et al.35 Energy associated with decommissioning is accounted for in the last year of the energy infrastructure’s lifetime, as shown in Eq. 18:\\n\\n$${E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}}}(t)=0.1\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}}}(t-\\\\tau )$$ (18)\\n\\nWe assume the historical trend of increasing EROIs of photovoltaic and wind power technologies will continue in the future. We model the EROI dynamics of these technologies by applying “energetic experience curves” (see Steffen et al.16 and Loueven et al.17), thus estimating the reduction in the energy requirements for construction, and operation and maintenance due to technological innovation. For a detailed explanation of how we calculated the future dynamics of EROI for photovoltaics, wind power, and hydrogen from electrolysis, see the “Note on EROI dynamics of wind and solar power” and the “Note on energy requirements for hydrogen from electrolysis” in the Supplementary Information. In estimating the energy requirements of hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear energy, we refer to the present-day range of EROI estimates, due to a lack of studies on EROI dynamics for these technologies.\\n\\nEROI of the overall energy system\\n\\nWe calculate the EROI of the overall energy system at the final energy stage, by applying Eq. 1, wherein we compare the total amount of gross final energy production to the sum of the energy requirements for all energy conversion technologies (here represented by the index i), as shown in Eq. 19. We use the same approach to calculate the EROI of individual energy conversion technologies and the EROI of different carriers, such as the EROI of electricity from renewables.\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{EROI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{SYS}}}}}}}}=\\\\frac{{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GROSS}}}}}}}}}{\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{i}{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{EXT}}}}}}},i}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REF}}}}}}},i}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{TRA}}}}}}},i}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CON}}}}}}},i}+{E}_{{{{{\\\\mathrm{{O}}}}}}{{\\\\&}}{{{{\\\\mathrm{{M}}}}}},i}+{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{DEC}}}}}}},i}}-1$$ (19)\\n\\nWe test our model by comparing our estimates of the EROI of the overall energy system with the results from the EROI literature. The note on “EROI estimates of different energy carriers” in the Supplementary Information demonstrates that our calculations of the EROI at the final energy stage are consistent with estimates from previous studies.\\n\\nEROI values differ greatly depending on the energy system boundaries that the analyst uses22,64. For example, some studies measure energy delivered at the point of energy extraction, while others calculate energy delivered to the end-user, which is an expanded analytical boundary of the system. Expanding the boundary results in lower EROI values, as it includes the additional energy required to convert the raw resource into useful energy and move or store it. We selected studies to match a consistent system boundary, which includes the energy investments for energy resource extraction, resource transportation, resource processing, the construction of energy conversion facilities, and the energy required for the operation of the facilities.\\n\\nWe assume a global average EROI for each energy conversion technology. We do not take into account regional differences in production and transformation processes28. However, the EROI of the entire energy system does change with improvements in energy conversion efficiencies, changes in the EROI ST of fossil fuels due to a declining abundance of these energy resources, and as the mix of energy technologies change over time.\\n\\nIn our EROI scenarios, high-EROI values assumed for each energy technology are based on studies with favourable assumptions regarding resource abundance and deployment of the most efficient low-carbon energy-generating technologies. Low-EROI values, in turn, assume lower resource abundance and limited technological improvement of low-carbon energy technologies. Median-EROI values represent a balanced, middle-of-the road EROI trajectory. For a detailed overview of EROI assumptions for different energy technologies, see Supplementary Tables 3–7.\\n\\nNet energy\\n\\nTo calculate net energy per capita, we divide the difference between gross final energy and the total energy requirements of the energy system (as shown in Eq. 1), by the global population projections in the mitigation pathways.\\n\\nEnergy system emissions\\n\\nEstimating the carbon emissions associated with the build-up of the energy system and the operation and maintenance of the energy supply during transition is crucial for assessing different mitigation pathways. If a substantial amount of the remaining carbon budget goes to decarbonising the energy system, this may significantly affect the projections of energy use and emissions in the end-use energy sectors. Future energy system emissions depend on changes in the energy requirements of the energy system and the carbon intensity of the energy for the energy system. Energy system emissions decrease with the decarbonisation of the energy supply and a reduction in energy requirements.\\n\\nTo calculate the emissions associated with the construction of energy technologies, and the operation and maintenance of the energy supply over time, we first separate the energy requirements associated with the construction, decommissioning, and operation and maintenance of the energy supply for each energy technology into the four energy carriers: electricity, gases, liquid fuels, and solids. This step is crucial to adequately quantify energy system emissions, as the carbon intensities of different energy carriers can differ substantially21, especially given that electricity can be decarbonised much faster than other carriers. We count hydrogen among the liquid fuels, assuming that most hydrogen will be destined to replace liquid fossil fuels. In decomposing the energy requirements into different energy carriers, we follow the approach of Arvesen et al.25, who distinguish between the four abovementioned energy carrier types, for each of the three life-cycle assessment phases of construction, decommissioning, and operation (see Eq. 20). The life-cycle phase of operation and maintenance includes both the energy requirements to operate the energy infrastructure as well as the energy required to maintain the energy supply. We use the life-cycle assessment database from Arvesen et al. to decompose the energy requirements into fourenergy carriers by multiplying the total energy requirements by the vector of the respective energy carriers shares, composed of electricity (e), gases (g), liquid fuels (l), and solids (s):\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\bf{E}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathbf{REQ}}}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}(t)={E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{REQ}}}}}}},i}\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\times \\\\langle e,g,l,s\\\\rangle_{i}$$ (20)\\n\\nEnergy requirements, decomposed into four energy carriers, are multiplied by the carbon intensity vector containing the carbon intensities of energy carriers (\\\\({{{{{\\\\bf{CI}}}}}}\\\\)), to obtain the energy system emissions from each respective energy generation technology, and the life-cycle phase, as shown in Eq. 21.\\n\\n$${{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{2,i}\\\\left(t\\\\right)={{{{{{\\\\bf{E}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\\\mathbf{REQ}}}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\\\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\bullet \\\\,{{{{{\\\\bf{CI}}}}}}(t)$$ (21)\\n\\nWe calculate the carbon intensity of each carrier (c) by dividing the total carbon emissions from energy generation for each carrier by the total amount of energy generated by each carrier, as shown in Eq. 21. Changes in the carbon intensities of energy carriers in the mitigation pathways over time are depicted in Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9.\\n\\n$${{{{{{\\\\rm{CI}}}}}}}_{c}(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{i}{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{2,i,c}(t)}{\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\\\limits_{i}{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GEN}}}}}}},i,c}(t)}$$ (22)\\n\\nEmissions from electricity generation are obtained directly from the original scenario data, whereas emissions from gases, liquids, and solids are calculated using the carbon intensities of energy conversion technologies (\\\\({\\\\varphi }_{i}\\\\)), which are endogenous to the REMIND model (see Eq. 23). For an overview of the carbon intensity parameters, see Supplementary Table 10.\\n\\n$${{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{2,i,c}(t)=\\\\,{\\\\varphi }_{i}\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,{E}_{{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{GEN}}}}}}},i,c}(t)$$ (23)\\n\\nCumulative energy system emissions are calculated as the sum of annual emissions from all of the energy generation technologies, over the period from 2020 to 2100. The share of energy emissions that is shown in Fig. 2 is calculated by dividing energy system emissions by the total carbon emissions from energy and industrial processes.\\n\\nWe report negative emissions, realised by BECCS technologies, separately from (positive) anthropogenic emissions. Negative emissions realised in energy generation are therefore not counted in the calculation of the carbon intensities of the four energy carriers. We refer to the negative emissions data, as they are reported in the original scenario data. Mitigation pathways report the total amount of sequestered carbon by BECCS technologies (gross negative emissions), but do not separately report the positive emissions from BECCS. Positive emissions from BECCS include the emissions from land-use change, the emissions from fertilisers, the emissions associated with the construction and operation of the BECCS energy facilities, and the carbon emitted along the biomass supply chain73.\\n\\nMitigation pathways use different reporting methodologies for the carbon removal by BECCS that, in some cases, combine gross carbon removal with removals in the land-use sector74. This makes it difficult to include the total positive emissions associated with BECCS in our energy system calculations. Here, we limit our analysis of energy system emissions to the emissions associated with the biomass supply and emissions from BECCS facilities, though emissions from land-use-change and fertiliser use may be an even bigger source of energy system emissions47,48. As a result, our estimates may considerably underestimate the energy system emissions in low-carbon energy transitions that assume a large-scale use of bioenergy, such as the S2 and S5 mitigations pathways.\\n\\nMultiple regression panel data analysis\\n\\nTo quantify the factors driving energy system emissions, we selected three independent variables: final energy use, the share of energy from conventional fossil fuels, and the share of energy for the energy system. Panel OLS multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the contribution of each of these factors. The estimated model is as follows:\\n\\n$${{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{2,k}\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\,\\\\gamma \\\\left(t\\\\right)+\\\\beta_{1} {x}_{1,k}\\\\left(t\\\\right)+\\\\beta_{2} {x}_{2,k}\\\\left(t\\\\right)+\\\\beta_{3} {x}_{3,k}\\\\left(t\\\\right)+{\\\\varepsilon }_{k}(t)$$ (24)\\n\\nwhere \\\\({{{{{{{\\\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{2,k}\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\) is the energy system emissions for pathway k in year t, \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) gives the coefficients for the three independent variables \\\\({x}\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is the time-specific term that controls for unobserved heterogeneity over time, and \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{k}\\\\) is the error term. Time fixed-effects were included in the model, given that we are interested in how the relationship between independent variables and energy system emissions varies between different pathways. Robust standard errors controlling for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation were estimated after testing for their presence in the balanced panel dataset.']"
